# Introduction to R and RStudio

In the first lesson of this course, we'll explore the basics of R as a language and tool for data analysis. We will install R and RStudio on our computers and navigate the RStudio Integrated Development Environment (IDE). By the end of this lesson, we will have gained familiarity with some of the core R concepts like variables and data types.

## What is R?

R is a free, open-source programming language built specifically for statistical computing and graphics. Developed by Ross Ihaka and Robert Gentleman at the University of Auckland, New Zealand in the early 90s, R is now maintained by the R Development Core Team and a flourishing community of developers who contribute add-on packages that extend the capabilities of R.

> **Advantages of R**
> 
> - While spreadsheets are great for storing data and basic analysis tasks, R lends itself well to more complex data manipulation, statistical analysis, and graphics.
> - Due to its open-source nature, anyone can contribute to it, resulting in a rich ecosystem of libraries and packages addressing a wide variety of computational needs.
> - Scripting functionality in R promotes reproducibility of research.

## R vs Python for Data Science

Both R and Python are popular languages for data science, each with its own strengths. While R has a steep learning curve, it excels at statistical operations and creating highly customizable and comprehensive visualizations. Python, on the other hand, is a more general-purpose programming language that is also used for data science through packages like NumPy and pandas.

>Get your feet wet by starting with R. As you hone your skills, consider learning Python too! Data scientists proficient in both languages are in high demand. 

## Installing R and RStudio

To get started, we'll need to install both R and RStudio on our computers. Here's how:

1. Download and install R from the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN).
2. Download and install RStudio which is an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) that makes using R much easier.

After you've installed R and RStudio, go ahead and open up RStudio!

## Tour of the RStudio Interface

RStudio consists of multiple panes to help with different aspects of your work. You may customize the layout of these panes to fit your workflow. The default layout consists of:

1. **Script**: This is where you'll be writing your scripts. You should see a blank script with an R logo.
2. **Console**: Similar to a terminal, it's where R runs your script code. You should see `>` (the R prompt).
3. **Environment/History** (tabbed): Displays objects that youâ€™ve defined in your R session and records your R command history.
4. **Files/Plots/Packages/Help** (tabbed): Lets you navigate your file system, displays plots made in R, lists installed R packages, and displays the R help documentation system.

Notably, you can set the working directory according to your projects, which helps RStudio keep things organized.

Good job on completing this first lesson! You are now familiar with R, have installed it along with its amazing companion RStudio, and explored its interface. Next up, we'll dive into some more R essentials such as functions and data import.

## Up Next

In the [next lesson](http://github.com/user/repo/blob/branch/lesson-link.md), we will dive deeper into understanding *Functions* and *Data Import* in R. With real-world datasets, you'll experience firsthand how powerful R is for managing and manipulating data. We'll see you there! Knowledge is power - let's keep going!
