  - title: Running Commands in the R Console
    text: Write a command in the R console that adds 3 and 5.
    solution: 3 + 5
    output: '[1] 8'
  - title: Assigning Variables
    text: Create a variable called 'name' and assign it the value 'John'.
    solution: name <- 'John'
    output: ''
  - title: Data Types
    text: What data type is the variable 'height' if its value is 175.5?
    solution: numeric
    output: ''
  - title: Vectors
    text: Create a numeric vector with the values 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
    solution: numbers <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
    output: ''
  - title: Performing Operations on Vectors
    text: >-
      Create two numeric vectors: v1 with the values 1, 2, 3 and v2 with the
      values 4, 5, 6. Add the two vectors together and assign the result to a
      variable called 'result'.
    solution: |-
      v1 <- c(1, 2, 3)
      v2 <- c(4, 5, 6)
      result <- v1 + v2
    output: ''
  - title: Lists
    text: >-
      Create a list called 'person' with three elements: a character element
      'name' with the value 'John Doe', a numeric element 'age' with the value
      30, and a character element 'city' with the value 'Chicago'.
    solution: person <- list(name = 'John Doe', age = 30, city = 'Chicago')
    output: ''
  - title: Matrices
    text: >-
      Create a matrix called 'matrix1' with the values 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. The
      matrix should have 2 rows and 3 columns.
    solution: matrix1 <- matrix(1:6, nrow = 2, ncol = 3)
    output: ''
  - title: Data Frames
    text: >-
      Create a data frame called 'data' with two columns: 'name' with the values
      'John', 'Jane', 'David' and 'age' with the values 30, 25, 35.
    solution: data <- data.frame(name = c('John', 'Jane', 'David'), age = c(30, 25, 35))
    output: ''
  - title: Review Exercise 1
    text: >-
      Write a command in the R console that calculates the product of two
      variables: x with the value 10 and y with the value 5.
    solution: "x <- 10\ty <- 5\nproduct <- x * y"
    output: ''
  - title: Review Exercise 2
    text: >-
      Create a logical vector called 'is_student' with the values TRUE, FALSE,
      TRUE.
    solution: is_student <- c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE)
    output: ''
  - title: Review Exercise 3
    text: >-
      Create a data frame called 'people' with three columns: 'name' with the
      values 'John', 'Jane', 'David', 'age' with the values 30, 25, 35, and
      'city' with the values 'Chicago', 'New York', 'Los Angeles.
    solution: >-
      people <- data.frame(name = c('John', 'Jane', 'David'), age = c(30, 25,
      35), city = c('Chicago', 'New York', 'Los Angeles'))
    output: ''
  - title: Review Exercise 4
    text: >-
      Write a command in the R console that calculates the average of the values
      in a numeric vector called 'grades' with the values 80, 90, 70.
    solution: |-
      grades <- c(80, 90, 70)
      average <- mean(grades)
    output: ''
  - title: Review Exercise 5
    text: >-
      Create a matrix called 'matrix2' with the values 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8,
      9, 10. The matrix should have 5 rows and 2 columns.
    solution: matrix2 <- matrix(1:10, nrow = 5, ncol = 2)
