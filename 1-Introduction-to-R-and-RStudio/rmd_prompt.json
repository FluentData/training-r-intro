    "content": "Rmarkdown is a superset of markdown. It allows you to embed R code in your markdown document. \nWhen you render the document, the R code is executed and the results are inserted into the final document. Below\nare some of the most common features of Rmarkdown that make it different from markdown.\n\n## Front Matter (YAML Header)\n\nUnlike .md files, .Rmd files require a YAML header at the top of the document. The header is enclosed by two lines with ---. \nIt can contain metadata such as title, author, date, and output format. An example YAML header might be:\n\n---\ntitle: \"My Analysis\"\nauthor: \"John Doe\"\ndate: \"2023-07-08\"\noutput:\n  html_document:\n    toc: true\n    theme: united\nparams:\n  sample_size: 100\n---\n\nCommon valid arguments that can appear in the YAML header include:\n\n  * **title**: The title of the document.\n  * **author**: The author(s) of the document. This can be a single author or a list.\n  * **date**: The date of the document.\n  * **output**: Specifies the output format of the document. This could be html_document, pdf_document, word_document, among others. \n  * **params**: You can use this field to parameterize your report. You can define parameters here and then refer to them in your document using params$param_name.\n  * **knit**: This is used to specify a custom rendering function. Normally, this isn't needed unless you're doing something complex or non-standard.\n  * **runtime**: This is used for \"notebook\" style .Rmd documents and can be set to shiny to make the document interactive or runtime: shiny_prerendered for an optimized version of Shiny.\n\n## R Code Chunks \n\nIn .Rmd files, you insert R code using chunks. A chunk starts and ends with three backticks, with {r} immediately following \nthe opening backticks to signify it's an R code chunk. For example, to create a histogram with the ggplot2 package, you would \ninclude a chunk like the following:\n\n```{r}\n    library(ggplot2)\n    ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ)) + \n      geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.5)\n```\n\n### R Code Chunk Options\n\nR code chunks can have options that control their behavior during knitting. Options are included in the chunk header right \nafter the `r`, like `{r option1 = value1, option2 = value2}`. Here are some of the most common options:\n\n  * eval: (TRUE/FALSE) If FALSE, the code chunk will not be evaluated, meaning the code won't be run.\n  * echo: (TRUE/FALSE) If FALSE, the code of the chunk will not be shown in the output document.\n  * include: (TRUE/FALSE) If FALSE, both the code and its results will be excluded from the output document.\n  * collapse: (TRUE/FALSE) If TRUE, the code and its output will be merged into a single block in the output.\n  * message: (TRUE/FALSE) If FALSE, messages generated by the code will not be included in the output.\n  * warning: (TRUE/FALSE) If FALSE, warnings generated by the code will not be included in the output.\n  * fig.cap: (\"text\") Provides a caption for figures generated by the code chunk.\n  * fig.height and fig.width: (numeric) Specify the height and width of the plot in inches.\n  * fig.align: (\"left\", \"center\", \"right\") Controls the alignment of the plot on the page.\n  * results: (\"markup\", \"hide\", \"asis\", \"hold\") Controls how the results are included in the output. \"markup\" \n             formats the results according to the output document type, \"hide\" hides the results, \"asis\" includes \n             the results as they are, and \"hold\" delays outputting the results until all code in the chunk has been evaluated.\n  * cache: (TRUE/FALSE) If TRUE, the results of the code chunk will be cached so they don't need to be recomputed each \n           time the document is compiled.\n  * dependson: (character vector) Specifies chunks that this chunk depends on. If any of those chunks change, this chunk \n               will be reevaluated even if caching is turned on.\n\n## Inline R Code\n\n  You can use R code inline with the rest of your text in .Rmd files. Enclose the R code with backticks and precede it with `r` \n  like so: `` `r 2 + 2` ``. This will be replaced by the result of the calculation when knit.\n\n## Rendering the Document\n\n  .Rmd documents are compiled using the `knitr` package to run the R code and the `rmarkdown` package to convert the .Rmd file \n  to its final output format. In RStudio, you can simply press the \"Knit\" button.\n\nYou're job is to convert lessons written in github-flavored markdown into Rmarkdown-based learnr tutorials. The user will present you\nwith a github-flavored markdown file and you will convert it to Rmarkdown that is suitable for use with the learnr package. This conversion\nincludes updating code chunks to use the learnr syntax, and adding a learnr tutorial header. It is important that you don't make significant\nto the content of the lesson, but rather focus on the conversion process and adding appropriate learnr exercises to the lesson.\n"

Thanks!\n\n# Introduction to R and RStudio\n\nWelcome to the first lesson of our R for Air Quality Data Science training course! In this lesson, we will introduce you to the R programming language and the RStudio integrated development environment. We will look at how to install these tools on your own computer and familiarize yourself with the environment where you will be doing most of your R programming. \n\nBy the end of this lesson, you will be able to:\n1. Install and setup R and RStudio.\n2. Understand core R concepts like variables, data types, vectors, lists, matrices, and data frames.\n\n## Why Use R?\n\nR is a programming language specialized for statistical analysis and data visualization. It was originally developed in academia, but it has since become widely used in industry and government. One of the main advantages of R is its open-source nature, which means that you can use it for free and that it has a large community of developers who constantly improve it and add new functionality. R's rich ecosystem of add-on packages will allow us to carry out complex data analysis tasks with a few commands.\n\n## Comparing R to Python for Data Science\n\nBoth R and Python are popular open-source languages for data science. While Python is a general-purpose language that can be used for many tasks beyond data analysis, R is a specialized language with a specific focus on statistics, data visualization, and data manipulation. This focus is particularly clear when looking at R's vast library of packages for statistical analysis. This does not mean that Python cannot do these tasks – it absolutely can, and very well – but R provides a more statistician-friendly environment. In this course, we will be diving deep into R's capabilities for air quality data analysis.\n\n## Installing R and RStudio\n\nTo get started with R, you will need to install two pieces of software: R itself and the RStudio integrated development environment (IDE). The R software is what actually interprets and runs your R code, while RStudio provides a user-friendly interface that makes interacting with R much easier.\n\n### 1. Install R\n\nR can be installed from the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN). Go to the [CRAN download page](https://cran.r-project.org/mirrors.html) and select a mirror that is close to your geographical location. Then click on the version of R for your operating system (Windows, Mac, Linux), and follow the instructions on the site to download and install R.\n\n### 2. Install RStudio\n\nNext, install RStudio. First, go to the [RStudio download page](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download). Under \"Installers for Supported Platforms\", click on the installer for your operating system and follow the instructions to download and install RStudio. \n\nNote: RStudio is not required for using R, but it makes it much easier to write and debug R code. \n\n## Tour of the RStudio Interface\n\nOnce you have installed both R and RStudio, you can open RStudio to see the main interface, which is organized into four main “panes”:\n\n1. The R Console (`bottom left by default`): This is where R is waiting for you to tell it what to do, and where it will show the results of the commands you run.\n2. The Script pane (`top left by default`): This is where you can write longer pieces of code or create documents that mix text, code, and output.\n3. The Environment/History pane (`top right by default`): Here, you can see a record of the commands you’ve previously entered and output you’ve previously computed (the “History” tab), as well as all the things you’ve defined and stored to use later (the “Environment” tab).\n4. The Files/Plots/Packages/Help pane (`bottom right by default`): This pane has multiple uses, from browsing what files you’ve got in your current working directory (the “Files” tab), to seeing the plots you’ve made (the “Plots” tab), to getting some help on what different functions do (the “Help” tab). \n\nYou can customize the layout of RStudio and the behavior of RStudio to suit your preferences. One common recommendation is to set RStudio to point to your project directory when you open a new session. Use the \"Global Options…\" in the Tools menu, then select \"R General\". In the \"Default working directory (when not in a project)\" you can browse and select your project directory. Click \"Apply\" and restart RStudio to see the changes.\n\nTo run any R command, simply type it into the console pane and hit `Enter`. For example, after typing `2 + 2` and hitting `Enter`, the console will show the result `4`.\n\nThis rudimentary command introduces us to the idea of R as a large, powerful calculator, and throughout this course we will incrementally build on that knowledge to harness the powerful statistical and data processing capabilities of the R programming language.\n\n## Wrapping up\n \nIn this lesson, we introduced the R programming language for data analysis, the benefits of using a programming language such as R over traditional spreadsheet software, and a comparison of the relative strengths of R and Python for data science. We also covered installation of R and RStudio on personal computers and took a brief tour of the RStudio ecosystem.\n\n----\n\nIn our upcoming [lesson](2-Functions-and-Data-Import/readme.md), we will delve deeper into functions and data import mechanisms in R!"
