    "content": "Rmarkdown is a superset of markdown. It allows you to embed R code in your markdown document. \nWhen you render the document, the R code is executed and the results are inserted into the final document. Below\nare some of the most common features of Rmarkdown that make it different from markdown.\n\n## Front Matter (YAML Header)\n\nUnlike .md files, .Rmd files require a YAML header at the top of the document. The header is enclosed by two lines with ---. \nIt can contain metadata such as title, author, date, and output format. An example YAML header might be:\n\n---\ntitle: \"My Analysis\"\nauthor: \"John Doe\"\ndate: \"2023-07-08\"\noutput:\n  html_document:\n    toc: true\n    theme: united\nparams:\n  sample_size: 100\n---\n\nCommon valid arguments that can appear in the YAML header include:\n\n  * **title**: The title of the document.\n  * **author**: The author(s) of the document. This can be a single author or a list.\n  * **date**: The date of the document.\n  * **output**: Specifies the output format of the document. This could be html_document, pdf_document, word_document, among others. \n  * **params**: You can use this field to parameterize your report. You can define parameters here and then refer to them in your document using params$param_name.\n  * **knit**: This is used to specify a custom rendering function. Normally, this isn't needed unless you're doing something complex or non-standard.\n  * **runtime**: This is used for \"notebook\" style .Rmd documents and can be set to shiny to make the document interactive or runtime: shiny_prerendered for an optimized version of Shiny.\n\n## R Code Chunks \n\nIn .Rmd files, you insert R code using chunks. A chunk starts and ends with three backticks, with {r} immediately following \nthe opening backticks to signify it's an R code chunk. For example, to create a histogram with the ggplot2 package, you would \ninclude a chunk like the following:\n\n```{r}\n    library(ggplot2)\n    ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ)) + \n      geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.5)\n```\n\n### R Code Chunk Options\n\nR code chunks can have options that control their behavior during knitting. Options are included in the chunk header right \nafter the `r`, like `{r option1 = value1, option2 = value2}`. Here are some of the most common options:\n\n  * eval: (TRUE/FALSE) If FALSE, the code chunk will not be evaluated, meaning the code won't be run.\n  * echo: (TRUE/FALSE) If FALSE, the code of the chunk will not be shown in the output document.\n  * include: (TRUE/FALSE) If FALSE, both the code and its results will be excluded from the output document.\n  * collapse: (TRUE/FALSE) If TRUE, the code and its output will be merged into a single block in the output.\n  * message: (TRUE/FALSE) If FALSE, messages generated by the code will not be included in the output.\n  * warning: (TRUE/FALSE) If FALSE, warnings generated by the code will not be included in the output.\n  * fig.cap: (\"text\") Provides a caption for figures generated by the code chunk.\n  * fig.height and fig.width: (numeric) Specify the height and width of the plot in inches.\n  * fig.align: (\"left\", \"center\", \"right\") Controls the alignment of the plot on the page.\n  * results: (\"markup\", \"hide\", \"asis\", \"hold\") Controls how the results are included in the output. \"markup\" \n             formats the results according to the output document type, \"hide\" hides the results, \"asis\" includes \n             the results as they are, and \"hold\" delays outputting the results until all code in the chunk has been evaluated.\n  * cache: (TRUE/FALSE) If TRUE, the results of the code chunk will be cached so they don't need to be recomputed each \n           time the document is compiled.\n  * dependson: (character vector) Specifies chunks that this chunk depends on. If any of those chunks change, this chunk \n               will be reevaluated even if caching is turned on.\n\n## Inline R Code\n\n  You can use R code inline with the rest of your text in .Rmd files. Enclose the R code with backticks and precede it with `r` \n  like so: `` `r 2 + 2` ``. This will be replaced by the result of the calculation when knit.\n\n## Rendering the Document\n\n  .Rmd documents are compiled using the `knitr` package to run the R code and the `rmarkdown` package to convert the .Rmd file \n  to its final output format. In RStudio, you can simply press the \"Knit\" button.\n\nYou're job is to convert lessons written in github-flavored markdown into Rmarkdown-based learnr tutorials. The user will present you\nwith a github-flavored markdown file and you will convert it to Rmarkdown that is suitable for use with the learnr package. This conversion\nincludes updating code chunks to use the learnr syntax, and adding a learnr tutorial header. It is important that you don't make significant\nto the content of the lesson, but rather focus on the conversion process and adding appropriate learnr exercises to the lesson.\n"

Thanks!\n\n# Writing Functions, Conditionals, and Loops\n\nIn our [previous lesson](../3-Subsetting-Sorting-and-Combining-Data/readme.md), we learned about subsetting, sorting and combining datasets in R. We used elementary methods to make this happen. However, to improve the efficiency of our tasks in the long run, we need to leverage the automation power of R by writing reusable functions and implementing control flow using `if/else` statements and loops. In this lesson, we're going to dive into how to implement these methods in R.\n\n---\n\n## Functions in R\n\nWhen performing a unique task repeatedly, creating a custom function can save us time by improving efficiency and readability. Functions are the basic building blocks of R programming, and they in-turn help in building more complex pieces of code. Let's start learning about how to write our own functions!\n\n### Defining a Custom Function\n\nIn R, a set of code can be encapsulated into a function using the `function()` keyword, where each function is a named sequence of statements.\n\n```r\nmy_function <- function() {\n    # Code here\n}\n\n# Call the function\nmy_function()\n```\n\n### Function Arguments\n\nA function, with no arguments, as in the above example, is not very useful. We can add parameters to a function by specifying them in the brackets of the `function()` call.\n\n```r\n# A function to calculate the square of a number\nsquare_num <- function(num) {\n    return(num * num)\n}\n\n# Call the function\nsquare_num(4) # returns 16\n```\n\nIn this function, `num` is an argument to the function and it's passed as a number to the function call.\n\n---\n\n## If/Else Statements\n\nIf/Else statements are used to execute a certain piece of code only when some conditions are met. This can come in handy when we want to control the code flow based on conditional logic.\n\n```r\n# If statement\nnum <- 10\nif (num > 5) {\n   print(\"Number is greater than 5\")\n}\n\n# If/Else statement\nif (num > 15) {\n   print(\"Number is greater than 15\")\n} else {\n   print(\"Number is not greater than 15\")\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## Iteration with For and While Loops\n\nLoops are powerful programming constructs which allow you to repeat a piece of code a certain number of times. We'll cover two types of loops - `for` and `while`.\n\n### For Loops\n\nA `for` loop is used for iterating over a sequence, usually a vector or a list, or until a certain condition is met.\n\n```r\n# For loop\nfor (i in 1:5) {\n   print(i)\n}\n```\n\nIn the above code, the loop will run 5 times printing values from 1 to 5.\n\n### While Loops\n\nA `while` loop executes repeatedly until a certain condition is met.\n\n```r\n# While loop\nnum <- 0\nwhile (num < 5) {\n    print(num)\n    num <- num + 1\n}\n```\n\nThe loop will run until `num` is smaller than 5.\n\n---\n\n## Putting It All Together\n\nOnce you have understanding about functions, conditionals and loops, you can begin to apply these concepts to automate data processing tasks. For instance, we could write a function that calculates mean of air quality parameters using `for` loop and `if/else` statements, making repetitive tasks much easier.\n\n```r\n# Placeholder for code block using chicago_aqs.csv\n```\n\n---\n\n## Up Next\n\nIn this lesson, we covered some of the fundamental concepts of R programming including how to define our own functions, use control logic with `if/else` statements and automating tasks with `for` and `while` loops. In essence, these concepts should provide the foundation for automating your data processing tasks on air quality datasets.\n\nTaking it a step further, in the [next lesson](../5-Plotting-with-ggplot2/readme.md), we'll delve into creating publication-quality graphics using `ggplot2`!"
