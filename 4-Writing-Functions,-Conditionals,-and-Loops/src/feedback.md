## Lesson Structure

* The lesson has a defined structure and precise content organization but is missing an introduction section summarizing the value of this lesson - why are functions, conditionals, and loops important for R programming and specifically in air quality data analysis

## Lesson Sections

* Functions in R
    * The `Defining a Custom Function` section can be improved by showing more complex examples requiring multiple expressions in a function.
    * Include more examples of functions with multiple parameters.
    * The `Function Arguments` section could provide more specific examples and commentary on specifying default values for function arguments.
* If/Else Statements
    * The introduction to this section could be extended to explain the importance of conditional statements in real-world data analysis. 
    * And some more complex scenario for usage of if/else structures in R programming could be given so that the user can understand the potential of conditional statements, such as nested if/else and else if structures.
* Iteration with For and While Loops
    * The concept of loops has been accurately presented, however, the lessons could should deeper into more complex looping scenarios, for example nesting of loops and using loops with lists and dataframes.
* Putting It All Together
    * There is room for improvement in terms of providing multiple practical examples of all the discussed concepts (functions, if/else statements, loops) working collectively to solve real-world problems with air quality data. 
    * The section 'Putting It All Together' can provide an example of a function that uses conditional and iterative operations. The `# Placeholder for code block using chicago_aqs.csv` comment is an incomplete segment of the lesson.
    This section should use the chicago_air.csv file for its examples.

## General Comments

* The lesson material lets starters have a base from where to grow their knowledge, however, it lacks broader coverage of engaging practices and examples. Expanding the breadth of practical examples would improve reinforcement of the concepts. 
* Additional materials and resources (books, websites, cheat sheets, etc.) that can help learners deepen their understanding of function, conditionals, and loops in R can also be provided.
* It would be beneficial to include some common error handling techniques and tips associated with these concepts.
* In general, the lesson needs to go more indepth into the concepts of functions, conditionals, and loops. The lesson is missing a lot of information that would be useful for a beginner to know.
* The lesson needs to have more examples and those examples need to be iterative. THe lesson should start with a simple function and then build on that function to show how to make it more complex. The same should be done for conditionals and loops.
