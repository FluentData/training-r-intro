title: Writing Functions, Conditionals, and Loops
description: >-
  Automate data tasks in R by writing reusable functions, conditional logic, and
  loops.
objectives:
  - Write custom functions in R
  - Use if/else statements and for/while loops to control program flow
  - Apply functions, conditionals, and loops to automate data processing tasks
topics:
  - title: Writing functions
    description: Syntax for defining custom functions in R.
    key_points:
      - Use fun <- function() {}
      - Return values with return()
  - title: Function arguments
    description: Adding arguments to functions.
    key_points:
      - Arguments passed to functions
      - Use args=DEFAULT to make optional
  - title: Conditional statements
    description: Using if/else logic to control code flow.
    key_points:
      - if(condition) {}
      - else {} executed when condition FALSE
      - Relational and logical operators
  - title: for loops
    description: Repeating code through iterative loops.
    key_points:
      - for(var in vector) {}
      - Iterates through elements
  - title: while loops
    description: Repeating code while condition is true.
    key_points:
      - while(condition) {}
      - Condition tested each iteration
      - Avoid infinite loops
  - title: Applying functions and loops
    description: Using custom functions and loops for data tasks.
    key_points:
      - Encapsulate repetitive tasks in functions
      - Automate batch operations with loops
