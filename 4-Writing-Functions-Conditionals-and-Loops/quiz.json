            "3",
            "None of these"
        ],
        "answer": 2,
        "explanation": "In the for loop structure for(i in ints){print(i)}, 'ints' is a vector c(1, 2, 3) . Hence, values 1, 2 and 3 will be printed sequentially. Thus, the last value printed will be 3."

        "answer": 1,

            "function = function_name(arguments){ body }"
        ],
        "answer": 1,
        "explanation": "In R, functions are defined using the syntax function_name <- function(arguments){ body }. Here, 'function_name' is the name of function you want to create, 'arguments' are the inputs to the function and 'body' is the code to be executed when the function is called."
