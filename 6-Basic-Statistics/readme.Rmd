## Introduction

Welcome to the guide on analyzing air quality data with R! This tutorial will provide you with the necessary tools and techniques to effectively analyze air quality data using the R programming language. R is widely used in the field of environmental data analysis and offers a wide range of functions and packages for statistical analysis, visualization, and more. In this tutorial, we will cover descriptive statistics, statistical tests, correlation analysis, and visualizations, all relevant to air quality data analysis. So let's get started!

## Descriptive Statistics

Descriptive statistics help us understand and summarize the characteristics of a dataset. Let's start by loading the air quality data for Chicago and explore some basic descriptive statistics.

```{r}
library(region5air)
data(chicago_air)

# Assign the ozone column to a variable
ozone <- chicago_air$ozone

```

### Min, Max, and Range

We can find the minimum, maximum, and range of the ozone values using the following functions:

```{r}
min(ozone, na.rm = TRUE)
```

```{r}
max(ozone, na.rm = TRUE)
```

```{r}
range(ozone, na.rm = TRUE)
```

### Summary Statistics

To get a summary of the distribution of the ozone values, we can use the `summary()` function:

```{r}
summary(ozone)
```

### Histogram and Boxplot

A histogram provides a visual representation of the distribution of the ozone values, while a boxplot helps us identify any outliers. Let's create these plots using the `hist()` and `boxplot()` functions, respectively:

```{r}
hist(ozone)
```

```{r}
boxplot(ozone)
```

## Measures of Central Tendency

Measures of central tendency help us understand the typical or central values of a dataset. Two commonly used measures are the mean and median. Let's calculate these measures for the ozone values.

```{r}
mean(ozone, na.rm = TRUE)
```

```{r}
median(ozone, na.rm = TRUE)
```

## Measures of Dispersion

Measures of dispersion help us understand the spread or variability of a dataset. Three commonly used measures are the variance, standard deviation, and interquartile range. Let's calculate these measures for the ozone values.

```{r}
var(ozone, na.rm = TRUE)
```

```{r}
sd(ozone, na.rm = TRUE)
```

```{r}
IQR(ozone, na.rm = TRUE)
```

## Statistical Tests

Statistical tests allow us to make inferences and determine the significance of relationships or differences in our data. In this section, we will cover two commonly used tests: the t-test and correlation analysis.

### T-test

The t-test is used to compare the means of two groups and determine if they are statistically different from each other. Let's perform a t-test on the ozone values for the months of March and June in the Chicago air quality dataset.

First, let's compare the ozone values for March and June using boxplots to visualize any differences:

```{r}
library(ggplot2)

ozone_march_june <- chicago_air[chicago_air$month %in% c(3, 6), ]

ggplot(ozone_march_june, aes(factor(month), ozone)) +
  geom_boxplot()
```

Next, we need to check if the ozone values for March and June follow a normal distribution. We can do this by plotting histograms:

```{r}
ggplot(ozone_march_june, aes(ozone)) +
  facet_grid(rows = "month") +
  geom_histogram()
```

To formally test for normality, we can use the Shapiro-Wilk test with the `shapiro.test()` function:

```{r}
ozone_march <- ozone_march_june[ozone_march_june$month == 3, "ozone"]
shapiro.test(ozone_march)
```

```{r}
ozone_june <- ozone_march_june[ozone_march_june$month == 6, "ozone"]
shapiro.test(ozone_june)
```

If the p-values from the Shapiro-Wilk tests are above 0.05, we can assume that the ozone values in both March and June follow a normal distribution. Now, let's perform the t-test to compare the means of the ozone values for March and June:

```{r}
t.test(ozone_march, ozone_june)
```

The output of the t-test will provide the test statistic, degrees of freedom, and p-value. If the p-value is below a significance level (e.g., 0.05), we can conclude that there is a statistically significant difference in the means of the ozone values between March and June.

### Correlation Analysis

Correlation analysis allows us to examine the relationship between two variables. Let's explore the correlation between ozone, temperature, and solar radiation in the Chicago air quality dataset.

First, we need to create a subset of the numeric columns in our dataset:

```{r}
chicago_numeric <- chicago_air[, c("ozone", "temp", "solar")]
```

We can then use the `cor()` function to calculate the correlation matrix, considering only complete observations:

```{r}
cor_matrix <- cor(chicago_numeric, use = "complete.obs", method = "pearson")
cor_matrix
```

To perform a correlation test between two specific variables, we can use the `cor.test()` function:

```{r}
cor.test(chicago_air$solar, chicago_air$temp, method = "pearson")
```

To visualize the correlation matrix, we can use the `ggcorrplot` package:

```{r}
library(ggcorrplot)
ggcorrplot(cor_matrix, lab = TRUE)
```

## Pairwise Plots

Pairwise plots are useful for visualizing relationships between multiple numeric variables. R provides the `pairs()` function and the `pairs.panels()` function from the `psych` package for this purpose.

```{r}
pairs(chicago_numeric, lower.panel = panel.smooth)
```

```{r}
library(psych)
pairs.panels(chicago_numeric, lm = TRUE)
```

## Other Statistical Tests

R offers a variety of statistical tests for analyzing categorical data. Here are a few commonly used tests and their respective functions:

- Chi Square Test: `chisq.test()`
- Fisher's Test: `fisher.test()`
- Analysis of Variance (ANOVA): `aov()`

Additionally, the `EnvStats` package provides a comprehensive list of basic and advanced statistical tests specifically for environmental data analysis.
