# Introduction to Basic Statistics in R

R, originally developed as a statistical programming language, is a perfect tool for performing basic statistics. Many built-in functions and community developed packages make for a seamless statistical analysis experience. This lesson will cover some statistical tests that you come across when working with environmental data.

```card:info
Throughout this lesson, we will use an ozone data set called `chicago_air` to demonstrate these concepts.
```

First, we need to load this ozone data and assign the ozone column to its own variable for quick access.

```r
library(region5air)
data(chicago_air)
ozone <- chicago_air$ozone
```

## Descriptive and Exploratory Statistics

R offers a number of built-in functions for descriptive statistics. The functions we will be exploring all have a parameter `na.rm` that instructs the function to exclude any `NA` values from the calculation.

Let's explore the range and the spread of our dataset:

```r
min(ozone, na.rm=T)
max(ozone, na.rm=T)
range(ozone, na.rm=T)
summary(ozone)
```

To visualize the data distribution, `hist()` and `boxplot()` come in handy.

```r
hist(ozone)
boxplot(ozone)
```

## Quiz Question
```question
? What does the 'na.rm' parameter stand for in these R functions?
! c. Remove NA values
- a. Name Abstract 
- b. No Answer
- c. Remove NA values
- d. Natural Algorithm
* 'na.rm' parameter stands for 'Remove NA values'. When set to TRUE, this parameter instructs the function to ignore or remove NA values during the calculation.
```

## Measures of Central Tendency and Dispersion

We can find the mean and median of the ozone concentration dataset using in-built functions.

```r
mean(ozone, na.rm=T)
median(ozone, na.rm=T)
```

Similarly, R provides functions to estimate the variance, standard deviation, and interquartile rangeâ€”crucial measures of dispersion.

```r
var(ozone,na.rm=T)
sd(ozone,na.rm=T)
IQR(ozone,na.rm=T)
```

## Useful Packages for Statistics

The `Hmisc`, `psych`, and `pastecs` packages offer functions that provide comprehensive statistical descriptions.

```r
library(Hmisc)
describe(ozone)

library(psych)
describeBy(ozone)

library(pastecs)
stat.desc(ozone, norm=T)
```

```card:info
Ensure you have these packages installed. If not, you can install them using the `install.packages()` function.
```

## Statistical Tests

R has a rich collection of built-in functions for various statistical tests. We'll use the `t.test()` function to perform a two sample t-test on our Chicago ozone data.

```exercise
? Why do we need to perform a Shapiro-Wilk test before any statistical tests?
! To confirm if data follows a normal distribution
- Hint 1: This test is related to the nature of our data distribution.
- Hint 2: Are we dealing with normal or non-normal data?
* The Shapiro-Wilk test is used to check whether data follows a normal distribution. This is important as many statistical tests assume that data is normally distributed. Outcomes of this test dictate what kind of statistical tests we can perform.
```

We will demonstrate differences between ozone concentrations in different months as they could be significantly different due to seasonal variations.

Next, we should also check the normality of ozone concentrations using histograms and the Shapiro-Wilk test.

You can run the correlation test using `cor.test()`. To create a correlation matrix graph, you can use `ggcorrplot`.

Lastly, pairwise plots can present an overview of relationships among variables.

```exercise
? What are the functions to create pairwise plots?
! pairs and pairs.panels
- Hint 1: One of the functions belongs to the base R and another is from the `psych` package.
- Hint 2: Both functions share a similar name.
* The `pairs()` function from base R and the `pairs.panels()` function from the `psych` package can be used to create pairwise plots.
```

Now, you should be comfortable with different statistical analyses in R. The `EnvStats` package provides an exhaustive list of statistical tests for environmental data.

In the next section, we will delve into more complex problems and explore these statistical tests in more detail.

# Challenges

If you are looking for an additional challenge and want to apply what you have learned, consider trying the following exercises:

```exercise
? How would you conduct a Fisher's Test using the `chicago_air` dataset?
! This is a hypothetical question. To carry out a Fisher's Test, we need two nominal variables to find out if there is a significant association between them. As such, the Fisher's Test might not be applicable to the `chicago_air` dataset.
- Hint 1: A Fisher's Test requires two nominal variables.
- Hint 2: This test is used to detect any association between the two variables.
* A Fisher's Test might not be applicable to the `chicago_air` dataset because we need two nominal variables. The Fisher's Test is useful for finding out if there is any significant association between the two variables. 

```exercise
? Perform a correlation analysis between 'solar' and 'temp' from the `chicago_air` dataset. Interpret the results.
! NA
- Hint 1: Start by subsetting the dataset.
- Hint 2: Use the 'cor()' function to find the correlation. Interpret the result in terms of the strength and direction of the correlation.
* NA
```
