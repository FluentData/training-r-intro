  - title: Calculating the Mean
    text: >-
      Write a function called `calculate_mean` that takes a vector of numbers as
      an argument and returns the mean value.

  - title: Concatenating Strings
    text: >-
      Write a function called `create_greeting` that takes a name (string) and
      an age (numeric) as arguments and returns a greeting message that includes
      the name and age.

  - title: Generating a Sequence
    text: >-
      Write a function called `generate_sequence` that takes a starting value,
      an ending value, and a step size as arguments and returns a vector
      containing the generated sequence.
    solution: >-
      generate_sequence <- function(start, end, step) { sequence <- seq(start,
      end, step) return(sequence) }

  - title: Install and Load a Package
    text: >-
      Write a function called `load_package` that takes the name of a package as
      an argument, installs the package, and loads it into the R session.
    solution: >-
      load_package <- function(package_name) { install.packages(package_name)

  - title: Importing Data from CSV
    text: >-
      Write a function called `import_csv` that takes the file path of a CSV
      file as an argument and imports the data into R as a data frame using the
      `read.csv()` function.
    solution: >-
      import_csv <- function(file_path) { data <- read.csv(file_path)
      return(data) }

  - title: Importing Data from Excel
    text: >-
      Write a function called `import_excel` that takes the file path of an
      Excel file as an argument, installs and loads the `readxl` package, and
      imports the data from the Excel file using the `read_excel()` function.
    solution: >-
      import_excel <- function(file_path) { install.packages('readxl')
      library(readxl) data <- read_excel(file_path) return(data) }

  - title: Using Functions
    text: >-
      Write a function called `data_summary` that takes a data frame as an
      argument, calculates the mean of a specific column using the `mean()`
      function, and returns a summary message that includes the mean value.
    solution: >-
      data_summary <- function(data, column) { mean_value <-
      mean(data[[column]]) summary <- paste('The mean of', column, 'is',
      mean_value) return(summary) }
