    "content": "Rmarkdown is a superset of markdown. It allows you to embed R code in your markdown document. \nWhen you render the document, the R code is executed and the results are inserted into the final document. Below\nare some of the most common features of Rmarkdown that make it different from markdown.\n\n## Front Matter (YAML Header)\n\nUnlike .md files, .Rmd files require a YAML header at the top of the document. The header is enclosed by two lines with ---. \nIt can contain metadata such as title, author, date, and output format. An example YAML header might be:\n\n---\ntitle: \"My Analysis\"\nauthor: \"John Doe\"\ndate: \"2023-07-08\"\noutput:\n  html_document:\n    toc: true\n    theme: united\nparams:\n  sample_size: 100\n---\n\nCommon valid arguments that can appear in the YAML header include:\n\n  * **title**: The title of the document.\n  * **author**: The author(s) of the document. This can be a single author or a list.\n  * **date**: The date of the document.\n  * **output**: Specifies the output format of the document. This could be html_document, pdf_document, word_document, among others. \n  * **params**: You can use this field to parameterize your report. You can define parameters here and then refer to them in your document using params$param_name.\n  * **knit**: This is used to specify a custom rendering function. Normally, this isn't needed unless you're doing something complex or non-standard.\n  * **runtime**: This is used for \"notebook\" style .Rmd documents and can be set to shiny to make the document interactive or runtime: shiny_prerendered for an optimized version of Shiny.\n\n## R Code Chunks \n\nIn .Rmd files, you insert R code using chunks. A chunk starts and ends with three backticks, with {r} immediately following \nthe opening backticks to signify it's an R code chunk. For example, to create a histogram with the ggplot2 package, you would \ninclude a chunk like the following:\n\n```{r}\n    library(ggplot2)\n    ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ)) + \n      geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.5)\n```\n\n### R Code Chunk Options\n\nR code chunks can have options that control their behavior during knitting. Options are included in the chunk header right \nafter the `r`, like `{r option1 = value1, option2 = value2}`. Here are some of the most common options:\n\n  * eval: (TRUE/FALSE) If FALSE, the code chunk will not be evaluated, meaning the code won't be run.\n  * echo: (TRUE/FALSE) If FALSE, the code of the chunk will not be shown in the output document.\n  * include: (TRUE/FALSE) If FALSE, both the code and its results will be excluded from the output document.\n  * collapse: (TRUE/FALSE) If TRUE, the code and its output will be merged into a single block in the output.\n  * message: (TRUE/FALSE) If FALSE, messages generated by the code will not be included in the output.\n  * warning: (TRUE/FALSE) If FALSE, warnings generated by the code will not be included in the output.\n  * fig.cap: (\"text\") Provides a caption for figures generated by the code chunk.\n  * fig.height and fig.width: (numeric) Specify the height and width of the plot in inches.\n  * fig.align: (\"left\", \"center\", \"right\") Controls the alignment of the plot on the page.\n  * results: (\"markup\", \"hide\", \"asis\", \"hold\") Controls how the results are included in the output. \"markup\" \n             formats the results according to the output document type, \"hide\" hides the results, \"asis\" includes \n             the results as they are, and \"hold\" delays outputting the results until all code in the chunk has been evaluated.\n  * cache: (TRUE/FALSE) If TRUE, the results of the code chunk will be cached so they don't need to be recomputed each \n           time the document is compiled.\n  * dependson: (character vector) Specifies chunks that this chunk depends on. If any of those chunks change, this chunk \n               will be reevaluated even if caching is turned on.\n\n## Inline R Code\n\n  You can use R code inline with the rest of your text in .Rmd files. Enclose the R code with backticks and precede it with `r` \n  like so: `` `r 2 + 2` ``. This will be replaced by the result of the calculation when knit.\n\n## Rendering the Document\n\n  .Rmd documents are compiled using the `knitr` package to run the R code and the `rmarkdown` package to convert the .Rmd file \n  to its final output format. In RStudio, you can simply press the \"Knit\" button.\n\nYou're job is to convert lessons written in github-flavored markdown into Rmarkdown-based learnr tutorials. The user will present you\nwith a github-flavored markdown file and you will convert it to Rmarkdown that is suitable for use with the learnr package. This conversion\nincludes updating code chunks to use the learnr syntax, and adding a learnr tutorial header. It is important that you don't make significant\nto the content of the lesson, but rather focus on the conversion process and adding appropriate learnr exercises to the lesson.\n"

Thanks!\n\n# Functions and Data Import\n\n## Introduction\n\nAfter learning about the basics of R and RStudio in the [previous lesson](./1-Introduction-to-R-and-RStudio/readme.tmd), it's time to explore some of the R's built-in functions and understand how to import data into R, specifically from CSVs and Excel files. These are fundamental skills any data scientist working in R will need.\n\n## What are Functions in R?\n\nIn R, a function is a piece of code that is used to perform a specific task. You can think of it as a machine that takes in inputs (called arguments), does something with them, and then gives back some output. Functions can simplify your code by allowing you to re-use the same code without having to write it out every time.\n\n### R's Built-in Functions\n\nR comes with a wide range of built-in functions. Let's look at a few of them:\n\n**mean()** function to calculate the average of a vector:\n\n```R\nnumbers <- c(5,10,15,20)\nmean(numbers)\n```\n\n**paste()** function to concatenate strings:\n\n```R\npaste(\"Hello,\", \"world!\")\n```\n\n**seq()** function to generate a sequence of numbers:\n\n```R\nseq(from = 1, to = 10, by = 2)  # generates 1, 3, 5, 7, 9\n```\n\n### Nesting Functions\n\nYou can place functions inside other functions, in which case the inner function(s) execute first. For example, you might want to calculate the average temperature for a particular month. To do this, you could first use the `subset()` function to extract the temperature data for that month, and then use the `mean()` function to calculate the average:\n\n```R\n# make sure to load the dataset \"chicago_air.csv\" before using this code\nchicago_air <- read.csv(\"../data/chicago_aqs.csv\")\n\nmean(subset(chicago_air, month == 6)$temp)\n```\n## Importing Data\n\nR's true power comes from its ability to analyze data. But before we can analyze data, we need to import it into R. In this section, we'll look at how to import CSV and Excel files into R.\n\n### CSV\n\nA common data format is the comma-separated values (CSV) file, which can be read into R using the `read.csv()` function. The function needs to know the path of the CSV file you wish to load. \n\n```R\n# Here we assume that the chicago_air.csv file is located in a`data` folder at the same level as this folder.\nchicago_air <- read.csv(\"../data/chicago_air.csv\")\n```\n\n\n### Excel\n\nFor reading Excel files, we can use libraries like `readxl`.\n\n```R\n# Before we can use 'readxl', we need to install and load it using the install.packages and library commands\n# Uncomment the lines below to install and load the readxl library\n# install.packages(\"readxl\")\n# library(readxl)\n\n# Then we can use the read_excel function from the readxl library to read the file.\n# chicago_air_excel <- read_excel(\"../data/chicago_air.xlsx\")\n```\n\n## Conclusion\n\nCongrats on getting through your first R functions and learning some basics about data import! These skills will be key foundations as we dive deeper into using R for air quality data science.\n\n## Additional Resources\n\n1.
