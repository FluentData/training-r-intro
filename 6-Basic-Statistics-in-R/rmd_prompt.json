    "content": "Rmarkdown is a superset of markdown. It allows you to embed R code in your markdown document. \nWhen you render the document, the R code is executed and the results are inserted into the final document. Below\nare some of the most common features of Rmarkdown that make it different from markdown.\n\n## Front Matter (YAML Header)\n\nUnlike .md files, .Rmd files require a YAML header at the top of the document. The header is enclosed by two lines with ---. \nIt can contain metadata such as title, author, date, and output format. An example YAML header might be:\n\n---\ntitle: \"My Analysis\"\nauthor: \"John Doe\"\ndate: \"2023-07-08\"\noutput:\n  html_document:\n    toc: true\n    theme: united\nparams:\n  sample_size: 100\n---\n\nCommon valid arguments that can appear in the YAML header include:\n\n  * **title**: The title of the document.\n  * **author**: The author(s) of the document. This can be a single author or a list.\n  * **date**: The date of the document.\n  * **output**: Specifies the output format of the document. This could be html_document, pdf_document, word_document, among others. \n  * **params**: You can use this field to parameterize your report. You can define parameters here and then refer to them in your document using params$param_name.\n  * **knit**: This is used to specify a custom rendering function. Normally, this isn't needed unless you're doing something complex or non-standard.\n  * **runtime**: This is used for \"notebook\" style .Rmd documents and can be set to shiny to make the document interactive or runtime: shiny_prerendered for an optimized version of Shiny.\n\n## R Code Chunks \n\nIn .Rmd files, you insert R code using chunks. A chunk starts and ends with three backticks, with {r} immediately following \nthe opening backticks to signify it's an R code chunk. For example, to create a histogram with the ggplot2 package, you would \ninclude a chunk like the following:\n\n```{r}\n    library(ggplot2)\n    ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ)) + \n      geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.5)\n```\n\n### R Code Chunk Options\n\nR code chunks can have options that control their behavior during knitting. Options are included in the chunk header right \nafter the `r`, like `{r option1 = value1, option2 = value2}`. Here are some of the most common options:\n\n  * eval: (TRUE/FALSE) If FALSE, the code chunk will not be evaluated, meaning the code won't be run.\n  * echo: (TRUE/FALSE) If FALSE, the code of the chunk will not be shown in the output document.\n  * include: (TRUE/FALSE) If FALSE, both the code and its results will be excluded from the output document.\n  * collapse: (TRUE/FALSE) If TRUE, the code and its output will be merged into a single block in the output.\n  * message: (TRUE/FALSE) If FALSE, messages generated by the code will not be included in the output.\n  * warning: (TRUE/FALSE) If FALSE, warnings generated by the code will not be included in the output.\n  * fig.cap: (\"text\") Provides a caption for figures generated by the code chunk.\n  * fig.height and fig.width: (numeric) Specify the height and width of the plot in inches.\n  * fig.align: (\"left\", \"center\", \"right\") Controls the alignment of the plot on the page.\n  * results: (\"markup\", \"hide\", \"asis\", \"hold\") Controls how the results are included in the output. \"markup\" \n             formats the results according to the output document type, \"hide\" hides the results, \"asis\" includes \n             the results as they are, and \"hold\" delays outputting the results until all code in the chunk has been evaluated.\n  * cache: (TRUE/FALSE) If TRUE, the results of the code chunk will be cached so they don't need to be recomputed each \n           time the document is compiled.\n  * dependson: (character vector) Specifies chunks that this chunk depends on. If any of those chunks change, this chunk \n               will be reevaluated even if caching is turned on.\n\n## Inline R Code\n\n  You can use R code inline with the rest of your text in .Rmd files. Enclose the R code with backticks and precede it with `r` \n  like so: `` `r 2 + 2` ``. This will be replaced by the result of the calculation when knit.\n\n## Rendering the Document\n\n  .Rmd documents are compiled using the `knitr` package to run the R code and the `rmarkdown` package to convert the .Rmd file \n  to its final output format. In RStudio, you can simply press the \"Knit\" button.\n\nYou're job is to convert lessons written in github-flavored markdown into Rmarkdown-based learnr tutorials. The user will present you\nwith a github-flavored markdown file and you will convert it to Rmarkdown that is suitable for use with the learnr package. This conversion\nincludes updating code chunks to use the learnr syntax, and adding a learnr tutorial header. It is important that you don't make significant\nto the content of the lesson, but rather focus on the conversion process and adding appropriate learnr exercises to the lesson.\n"

Thanks!\n\n# Basic Statistics in R\n\nIn the previous [lesson](./5-Plotting-with-ggplot2/readme.tmd), we used ggplot2 to create visualizations of air quality data. With the ability to visualize our data, we'll now learn how to describe the data numerically and perform some basic statistical analyses.\n\nWe'll be focusing on descriptive statistics, t-tests, one-way ANOVA, and simple linear regression. You might be familiar with some of these techniques from using Excel, but we'll explore how to perform them in R, where they can be integrated into scripts for automation and reproducibility.\n\n## Descriptive Statistics\n\nTo understand our data, we often start by calculating descriptive or summary statistics. \n\n### Mean and Median\n\nWe can use the `mean()` function to calculate average of a numeric vector. For example, to find the mean ozone level in our chicago_air dataset, we run:\n\n```r\nmean(chicago_air$ozone, na.rm = TRUE)\n```\n\nNote the `na.rm = TRUE` argument, which instructs R to ignore `NA` values when calculating the mean.\n\nThe median, or the middle value in a sorted list of numbers, can be calculated using the `median()` function in the same way.\n\n```r\nmedian(chicago_air$ozone, na.rm = TRUE)\n```\n\n### Standard Deviation and Variance\n\nTo quantify the spread of numeric data, we can compute the standard deviation with the `sd()` function, and the variance with the `var()` function.\n\n```r\n# Standard Deviation\nsd(chicago_air$ozone, na.rm = TRUE)\n\n# Variance\nvar(chicago_air$ozone, na.rm = TRUE)\n```\n\n### Correlation\n\nTo assess the relationship between two numeric variables, we can calculate their correlation using the `cor()` function.\n\n```r\n# Correlation between temperature and ozone\ncor(chicago_air$temp, chicago_air$ozone, use = \"pairwise.complete.obs\")\n```\n\nThe `use = \"pairwise.complete.obs\"` argument asks R to ignore pairs of values that include at least one `NA`.\n\n## T-Tests\n\nThe `t.test()` function in R allows us to conduct t-tests, which can be used to test hypotheses about population means.\n\n```r\n# one-sample t-test: Is the mean ozone concentration different from 0.035 ppm?\nt.test(chicago_air$ozone, mu = 0.035, na.rm = TRUE)\n```\n\nResults are returned in a compact form, stating the t-value, degrees of freedom, and p-value among others. \n\n## One-way ANOVA\n\nAnalysis of variance (ANOVA) can be used to test for the equality of three or more means. We can perform a one-way ANOVA with the `aov()` function. \n\nLet's test whether there's a difference in mean ozone concentration between months.\n\n```r\n# One-way ANOVA of ozone with respect to month\nanova_model <- aov(ozone ~ month, data = chicago_air)\nsummary(anova_model)\n```\n\nThe `summary` function gives us the results including the F-statistic and p-value.\n\n## Simple Linear Regression\n\nFinally, we can build simple linear regression models using the `lm()` function.\n\nLet's fit a model to predict ozone level from temperature:\n\n```r\n# Fit a linear model\nlm_model <- lm(ozone ~ temp, data = chicago_air)\n\n# Display the model's summary\nsummary(lm_model)\n```\n\nThis model's summary provides regression coefficients, standard errors, t-values, and p-values, among other things.\n\nIn this lesson, you've learned how to compute basic statistics in R. In the next [lesson](./7-Data-Transformation-and-Simple-Regression/readme.tmd), we'll transform our data and delve deeper into regression analysis."
