exercises:
  - title: Mean and Median
    text: >-
      Calculate the mean and median of the `ozone` variable in the `chicago_air`
      dataset.
    solution: |-
      mean_ozone <- mean(chicago_air$ozone)
      median_ozone <- median(chicago_air$ozone)
    output: |-
      mean_ozone
      median_ozone
    hints: []
    explanation: >-
      The mean is the average of all the values in the dataset, while the median
      is the middle value when the dataset is sorted in ascending order.
  - title: Standard Deviation and Variance
    text: >-
      Calculate the standard deviation and variance of the `temp` variable in
      the `chicago_air` dataset.
    solution: |-
      sd_temp <- sd(chicago_air$temp)
      var_temp <- var(chicago_air$temp)
    output: |-
      sd_temp
      var_temp
    hints: []
    explanation: >-
      The standard deviation measures the average amount by which data points
      deviate from the mean, while the variance is the average of the squared
      deviations from the mean.
  - title: Correlation
    text: >-
      Calculate the correlation coefficient between the `ozone` and `temp`
      variables in the `chicago_air` dataset.
    solution: correlation <- cor(chicago_air$ozone, chicago_air$temp)
    output: correlation
    hints: []
    explanation: >-
      Correlation measures the strength and direction of the linear relationship
      between two variables. It takes values between -1 and 1, where -1
      indicates a perfect negative correlation, 1 indicates a perfect positive
      correlation, and 0 indicates no correlation.
  - title: Confidence Intervals
    text: >-
      Perform a t-test and calculate a confidence interval for the mean ozone
      concentration in the `chicago_air` dataset.
    solution: |-
      t_test <- t.test(chicago_air$ozone)
      conf_interval <- t_test$conf.int
    output: conf_interval
    hints: []
    explanation: >-
      Confidence intervals provide a range of plausible values for a population
      parameter, such as a population mean. t-tests can be used to calculate
      confidence intervals for means.
  - title: ANOVA Analysis
    text: >-
      Perform ANOVA analysis on the ozone concentrations grouped by month in the
      `chicago_air` dataset.
    solution: |-
      anova_result <- aov(ozone ~ month, data = chicago_air)
      summary(anova_result)
    output: anova_result
    hints: []
    explanation: >-
      ANOVA (Analysis of Variance) is used to compare the means of three or more
      groups. It determines whether there are any statistically significant
      differences among the means and provides an overall measure of
      variability.
  - title: Linear Regression
    text: >-
      Fit a simple linear regression model to the `chicago_air` dataset with
      ozone as the dependent variable and temperature as the independent
      variable.
    solution: |-
      lm_model <- lm(ozone ~ temp, data = chicago_air)
      summary(lm_model)
    output: lm_model
    hints: []
    explanation: >-
      Linear regression allows us to model the relationship between a dependent
      variable and one or more independent variables. It can be used to predict
      the value of the dependent variable based on the values of the independent
      variables.
  - title: Practice Exercise 1
    text: >-
      Calculate the mean and median of the `wind_speed` variable in the
      `chicago_air` dataset.
    solution: |-
      mean_wind_speed <- mean(chicago_air$wind_speed)
      median_wind_speed <- median(chicago_air$wind_speed)
    output: |-
      mean_wind_speed
      median_wind_speed
    hints: []
    explanation: >-
      The mean is the average of all the values in the dataset, while the median
      is the middle value when the dataset is sorted in ascending order.
  - title: Practice Exercise 2
    text: >-
      Calculate the standard deviation and variance of the `pressure` variable
      in the `chicago_air` dataset.
    solution: |-
      sd_pressure <- sd(chicago_air$pressure)
      var_pressure <- var(chicago_air$pressure)
    output: |-
      sd_pressure
      var_pressure
    hints: []
    explanation: >-
      The standard deviation measures the average amount by which data points
      deviate from the mean, while the variance is the average of the squared
      deviations from the mean.

      correlation, and 0 indicates no correlation.

      speed in the `chicago_air` dataset.

      day in the `chicago_air` dataset.
