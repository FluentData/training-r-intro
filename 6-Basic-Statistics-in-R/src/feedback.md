## Lesson Structure

* The lesson follows the general structure as planned, covering introductory material, descriptive statistics, ANOVA, and simple linear regression
* The connection between this lesson and the previous one could be made clearer. While the sentence introducing the lesson refers to the visuals from the previous lesson, it does not clearly state why these statistics are important following the visuals. This should be clarified to show the progression and chain of thought.

## Lesson Sections

Under each topic: 

* Introduction  
    * The introduction is well done but could do with a brief summary of the previous lesson and perhaps a more explicit statement about the overarching value of this lesson.

* Descriptive Statistics  
    * Include the `summary()` function in R which can provide a quick overview of the data's main descriptors including the Min, 1st Qu., Median, Mean, 3rd Qu., and Max.

* T-Tests  
    * The point explaining what a t-test is is very brief. It could do with a more detailed explanation, especially for beginners who may not be familiar with the concept.  
    * Consider including a note to explain the "mu" parameter used in the t.test function call.   
   
* One-way ANOVA  
    * Similar to the t-test, a more detailed explanation of what a one-way ANOVA is would be beneficial for beginners who may not know what this test is used for.

* Simple Linear Regression  
    * It is important to include how to interpret the output of the linear model. This would provide added value for individuals who may not have a statistical background.    
   
## Tone and Formatting

* The language used is generally simple and easy to understand
* Try to avoid using technical terms like "population means" without first explaining the context. Remember, you are dealing with people who understand the environment, not necessarily statistics, so taking the time to explain these terms will go a long way in helping them understand the content of the lessons.

## Lesson Content

* Considering the specific audience, the lesson could do with some context about when these statistical concepts might be utilized in the real world of environmental regulation and policy.
* In general, this lesson should be fleshed out more and more examples should be included to help the reader understand the concepts.
* The lesson should include more information about the statistical concepts and how they are used in the real world. The lesson should also include more examples and those examples should be iterative. The lesson should start with a simple example and then build on that example to show how to make it more complex.
