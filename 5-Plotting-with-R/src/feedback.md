## Lesson Structure

* The "Introduction to ggplot2" section needs a bit more detail. The explanation of how to install and load the package isn't clear and should be expanded upon.
* A feature list of ggplot2 would be helpful in explaining why the learners should use it over base R graphs. 
* More introductions or overviews are needed before the code examples for all graph, chart and plot types. 

## General Feedback

* The 'Box Plots with ggplot2' section should explain the interpretation of box plots before going into code examples. 
* Most sections jump immediately into code examples without fully defining the topic. For example, a scatter plot is defined after its code implementation has been shown. The topic should ideally be explained before a code example is given. 
* In the ggplot2 sections, aesthetics and how they effect plots should be explained. 

## Lesson Sections

* Introduction
    * This section only states what will be covered and doesn't provide a rationale for why plotting is important in data analysis. Add more context on the necessity of data visualization.

* Base R Plots
    * This section could use more types of base R plots. Bar plots and density plots could be useful additions. 

* Scatter Plots
    * Explain what scatter plots are used for before giving the code to create one. 

* Histograms with hist()
    * Explain histograms before diving into code example. What do they represent and how are they helpful? 

* Boxplots with boxplot()
    * This section assumes that the learner knows what a box plot depicts. Provide an explanation before moving onto code examples. 

* Introduction to ggplot2
    * Some of the benefits of using ggplot2 over base R graphs should be stated in this section.
    * Explain what 'aesthetics' are in ggplot2 as the term is used multiple times throughout the rest of the lesson. 

* Scatter Plots with ggplot2
    * State what a scatter plot can help visualize before moving straight into code example.
    * As you add new customization functions to ggplot2 plots, explain what each function is before the example.

* Box Plots with ggplot2
    * Define a box plot and its utility before going into code examples. 
    * As you add new customization functions to ggplot2 plots, explain what each function is before the example.
* Facets with ggplot2
    * Provide examples of situations where facets could be useful before diving into code. 
    * As you add new customization functions to ggplot2 plots, explain what each function is before the example.

* Summary 
    * The summary is lacking a complete overview of what was covered in the lesson. Add a recap of every point that was taught. 
    * The link between this lesson and the next doesn't feel fleshed out. It should explain how data visualization will play a useful role in performing statistical analyses.
