## Lesson Structure

* The "Introduction to ggplot2" section needs a bit more detail. The explanation of how to install and load the package isn't clear and should be expanded upon.
* A feature list of ggplot2 would be helpful in explaining why the learners should use it over base R graphs. 
* More introductions or overviews are needed before the code examples for all graph, chart and plot types. 

## General Feedback

* Always begin with a simple example and the build on it by adding more customization as the section progresses.
* Assume that the learner has no prior R knowledge and explain every step in detail. It is always better to say too much than not enough.

## Lesson Sections

* Introduction
    * This section only states what will be covered and doesn't provide a rationale for why plotting is important in data analysis. Add more context on the necessity of data visualization.

* Base R Plots
    * This section could use more types of base R plots. Bar plots and density plots could be useful additions. 
    * Give a brief explanation of what each plot type is and when to use it before diving into code examples.
    * Give a list of common arguements and what they do after each plot example.

* Introduction to ggplot2
    * state some of the benefits of using ggplot2 over base R graphs
    * Explain what 'aesthetics' are in ggplot2 as the term is used multiple times throughout the rest of the lesson. 
    * Start with a simple graph and continue to add more customization to it as the lesson progresses.
    * As you add new customization functions to the ggplot2 plots, explain what each function is before the example.
    * Provide examples of situations where facets could be useful before diving into code. 

* Summary 
    * The summary is lacking a complete overview of what was covered in the lesson. Add a recap of every point that was taught. 
    * The link between this lesson and the next doesn't feel fleshed out. It should explain how data visualization will play a useful role in performing statistical analyses.
