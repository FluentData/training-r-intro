# Introduction to R for Air Data Analysis

This repository contains training materials for learning the R programming language, specifically tailored towards air data analysis. The training is structured into distinct lessons, each focusing on a different aspect of R programming. Each lesson is contained in a separate folder, and includes a README.md file with the lesson material.

## Lessons

1. **Introduction to R**: This lesson provides a basic introduction to R, including how to install and set up R and RStudio, an overview of R syntax, and how to perform simple operations.

2. **Functions and Importing Data**: This lesson covers the use of functions in R, including built-in functions and how to create your own. It also discusses how to import data from various formats, such as CSV and Excel, and how to explore and manipulate this data in R.

3. **Data Exploration and Visualization*: This lesson covers how to subset data using indexing and logical operators, sort data using the `order()` function, and combine data frames using `rbind()` and `cbind()` functions in R.

4. **Writing Functions, Conditionals, and Loops**: This lesson introduces the concept of writing functions in R, using conditionals to control the flow of execution, and implementing loops for repetitive tasks.
    
5. **Plotting**: This lesson focuses on visualizing data using various plotting techniques in R, including scatter plots, line graphs, and histograms.

6. **Basic Statistics**: This lesson covers the basics of statistical analysis in R, including calculating means, medians, standard deviations, and correlations.

7. **Regression and Data Transformation**: This lesson explores the use of linear regression to understand relationships between variables, and how to transform data to fit linear models.

8. **Quality Assurance**: This lesson discusses quality assurance in data analysis, including checking data types, handling outliers, dealing with missing data, and other common pitfalls.
