In the previous lesson, we delved into basic statistical analysis using R. We calculated descriptive statistics, conducted hypothesis tests, and even fit basic linear models. Now, using those foundational skills, we kick things up a notch. Get ready to dive into the heart of data preprocessing and regression modeling!\n\n## Data Transformations \n\nData transformations are a ubiquitous method in statistical analysis including air quality data. They help to stabilize variance, make the data more closely align with the assumptions of the inferential model, and improve interpretability. \n\n### Log, Square root & Box-Cox\n\nFor measurements that are skewed, we may apply transformations to reexpress our data for improved analysis. For instance, air pollutant data is often skewed right because it cannot go below zero, but there can be some very high values during pollution events.\n\nLet's import our air quality data and try out some transformations.\n  \n```R\n# Import the data\ndata <- read.csv(\"./data/chicago_air.csv\")\n\n# Apply a square root transformation\ndata$sqrt_ozone <- sqrt(data$ozone)\n\n# Apply a log transformation\ndata$log_ozone <- log(data$ozone)\n\n# Use the boxcox() function to do a Box-Cox transformation\nlibrary(MASS)  # boxcox() is in MASS package\ndata$bc_ozone <- boxcox(data$ozone ~ 1, lambda = seq(-0.5, 0.5, by=0.1))\n``` \n\nThe log, square root and Box-Cox are common transformations when dealing with skewed data. Note that Box-Cox is a family of transformations and requires us to choose a 'lambda' parameter that determines the specific transformation to apply.\n\n## Regression Analysis \n\nWe've previously built a simple linear model. It's now time to take it up a notch and bring our new skills together. \n\n### Simple Linear Regression Model \n\nJust to refresh, here's how you would build a simple linear model of the relationship of temperature with the ozone.\n\n```R\n# Fit the model\nmodel <- lm(ozone ~ temp, data = data)\n\n# Model summary\nsummary(model)\n```\n\nThis tells us if there's a statistically significant linear relationship between temperature and ground level ozone concentration. \n\n### Confidence Intervals \n\nWhile summarizing the model will give us coefficient estimates, we can also compute their confidence intervals using the `confint()` function.\n\n```R\n# Confidence intervals for model coefficients\nconfint(model)\n```\n\n## Missing Data \n\nReal-world air quality data often contains missing values, referred to as NAs in R. Before doing many operations in R, we usually need to handle these.\n\n### Handling Missing Values \n\n```R\n# Total number of NAs in dataset\nsum(is.na(data$ozone))\n\n# Remove rows with NA values\ndata <- na.omit(data)\n\n# Check if NAs are removed\nsum(is.na(data$ozone))\n```\n\n## Outliers \n\nFinally, let's discuss outliers in our data. Outliers can greatly affect our analysis, especially models because they can lead to erroneous conclusions. \n\n### Identifying and Handling Outliers\n\nLet's use boxplots to identify potential outliers in our dataset. Boxplots represent the median (middle line), first and third quartiles (box), and the range (whiskers). Outliers are shown as individual points outside the whiskers.\n\n```R\n# Create a boxplot\nboxplot(data$ozone, main = \"Boxplot of Ozone levels\", ylab = \"Ozone (ppm)\", col = \"blue\")\n```\nIf outliers are found, you could consider removing them, winsorizing the data (replacing outliers with less extreme values), or use robust statistical methods designed to be not too badly affected by outliers.\n\n## Wrapping up\n\nIn this lesson, we dove deep into the world of data pre-processing before regression analysis, including important topics like data transformations, regression modeling, handling missing data and outliers. All of these make up key steps for accurately interpreting real-world air quality data. \n\n**[Up Next](../8-quality-assurance/readme.tmd)**: As we near the end of this introductory R course, we will look at ensuring the quality of our data and output. Remember, there will always be garbage-in, garbage-out phenomenon in data science, to get quality output, you need to ensure the quality of the input. Head on over to the next lesson where we will learn techniques to assess and improve data quality!"
