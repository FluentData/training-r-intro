## Lesson Structure

* The lesson is missing a section on using multiple regression models

## Lesson Sections

* Introduction
    * This section is well done, provides an engaging introduction of the content
    
* Data Transformations 
    * While the section explains the uses of transformation, it could benefit from a stronger emphasis on the significance of data transformations specifically within the context of Air Quality Data analysis
    * Add an example to demonstrate how these transformations impact model performance or statistical analysis

* Log, Square root & Box-Cox
    * This subsection does a good job detailing data transformation techniques in theory, however, their application with specific examples relating to air quality data is missing
    * More visual comparisons would be beneficial to illustrate the effect of transformations on the given dataset. This could include histograms or density plots showing the distribution before and after the transformations.

* Regression Analysis 
    * Capably introduces regression analysis and reports a continuation from previous coursework
    
* Simple Linear Regression Model
    * Bring in more context specific to air quality when discussing the impact and interpretation of the model results 

* Confidence Intervals
    * More detail on the interpretation of confidence intervals in this context is needed
    * Consider explaining how the confidence interval can guide analysts in their decision making

* Missing Data 
    * Explain why these steps are necessary and what impact they could have on a data analysis, particularly in relation to air quality data

* Handling Missing Values 
    * Apart from removing NAs, also discuss other approaches to dealing with missing data such as interpolation, imputation, and how these can impact analysis results

* Outliers 
    * A brief explanation of how outliers can impact data analysis, especially in the context of air quality data, would be beneficial 

* Identifying and Handling Outliers
    * To make the lesson more engaging and easier to understand, consider adding an example where outliers significantly alter the result of an analysis
    * The consequences or potentially misleading results from not correctly handling outliers can make the example more tangible and impactful
    * Make a note about how certain air quality data may have valid reasons for outliers, such as pollution events, and that blanket removal may not always be the best approach

* Wrapping up
    * The conclusion is concise and neatly summarizes the topics covered in the lesson
    * However, it would be beneficial to provide a small practical scenario where all these steps would be applied together to give the reader an overview of the process in a real-world context.

* Up Next
    * A clear explanation is provided about what will be covered in the next lesson; however, the link to the next lesson is missing. 
    * Please ignore this if it's caused by an issue with rendering, as that falls under the "issues to ignore" category in the instructions.
