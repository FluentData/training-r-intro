    "content": "Rmarkdown is a superset of markdown. It allows you to embed R code in your markdown document. \nWhen you render the document, the R code is executed and the results are inserted into the final document. Below\nare some of the most common features of Rmarkdown that make it different from markdown.\n\n## Front Matter (YAML Header)\n\nUnlike .md files, .Rmd files require a YAML header at the top of the document. The header is enclosed by two lines with ---. \nIt can contain metadata such as title, author, date, and output format. An example YAML header might be:\n\n---\ntitle: \"My Analysis\"\nauthor: \"John Doe\"\ndate: \"2023-07-08\"\noutput:\n  html_document:\n    toc: true\n    theme: united\nparams:\n  sample_size: 100\n---\n\nCommon valid arguments that can appear in the YAML header include:\n\n  * **title**: The title of the document.\n  * **author**: The author(s) of the document. This can be a single author or a list.\n  * **date**: The date of the document.\n  * **output**: Specifies the output format of the document. This could be html_document, pdf_document, word_document, among others. \n  * **params**: You can use this field to parameterize your report. You can define parameters here and then refer to them in your document using params$param_name.\n  * **knit**: This is used to specify a custom rendering function. Normally, this isn't needed unless you're doing something complex or non-standard.\n  * **runtime**: This is used for \"notebook\" style .Rmd documents and can be set to shiny to make the document interactive or runtime: shiny_prerendered for an optimized version of Shiny.\n\n## R Code Chunks \n\nIn .Rmd files, you insert R code using chunks. A chunk starts and ends with three backticks, with {r} immediately following \nthe opening backticks to signify it's an R code chunk. For example, to create a histogram with the ggplot2 package, you would \ninclude a chunk like the following:\n\n```{r}\n    library(ggplot2)\n    ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ)) + \n      geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.5)\n```\n\n### R Code Chunk Options\n\nR code chunks can have options that control their behavior during knitting. Options are included in the chunk header right \nafter the `r`, like `{r option1 = value1, option2 = value2}`. Here are some of the most common options:\n\n  * eval: (TRUE/FALSE) If FALSE, the code chunk will not be evaluated, meaning the code won't be run.\n  * echo: (TRUE/FALSE) If FALSE, the code of the chunk will not be shown in the output document.\n  * include: (TRUE/FALSE) If FALSE, both the code and its results will be excluded from the output document.\n  * collapse: (TRUE/FALSE) If TRUE, the code and its output will be merged into a single block in the output.\n  * message: (TRUE/FALSE) If FALSE, messages generated by the code will not be included in the output.\n  * warning: (TRUE/FALSE) If FALSE, warnings generated by the code will not be included in the output.\n  * fig.cap: (\"text\") Provides a caption for figures generated by the code chunk.\n  * fig.height and fig.width: (numeric) Specify the height and width of the plot in inches.\n  * fig.align: (\"left\", \"center\", \"right\") Controls the alignment of the plot on the page.\n  * results: (\"markup\", \"hide\", \"asis\", \"hold\") Controls how the results are included in the output. \"markup\" \n             formats the results according to the output document type, \"hide\" hides the results, \"asis\" includes \n             the results as they are, and \"hold\" delays outputting the results until all code in the chunk has been evaluated.\n  * cache: (TRUE/FALSE) If TRUE, the results of the code chunk will be cached so they don't need to be recomputed each \n           time the document is compiled.\n  * dependson: (character vector) Specifies chunks that this chunk depends on. If any of those chunks change, this chunk \n               will be reevaluated even if caching is turned on.\n\n## Inline R Code\n\n  You can use R code inline with the rest of your text in .Rmd files. Enclose the R code with backticks and precede it with `r` \n  like so: `` `r 2 + 2` ``. This will be replaced by the result of the calculation when knit.\n\n## Rendering the Document\n\n  .Rmd documents are compiled using the `knitr` package to run the R code and the `rmarkdown` package to convert the .Rmd file \n  to its final output format. In RStudio, you can simply press the \"Knit\" button.\n\nYou're job is to convert lessons written in github-flavored markdown into Rmarkdown-based learnr tutorials. The user will present you\nwith a github-flavored markdown file and you will convert it to Rmarkdown that is suitable for use with the learnr package. This conversion\nincludes updating code chunks to use the learnr syntax, and adding a learnr tutorial header. It is important that you don't make significant\nto the content of the lesson, but rather focus on the conversion process and adding appropriate learnr exercises to the lesson.\n"

Thanks!\n\n# Data Transformation and Regression\n\nWelcome back! In the previous lesson, we delved into basic statistical analysis using R. We calculated descriptive statistics, conducted hypothesis tests, and even fit basic linear models. Now, using those foundational skills, we kick things up a notch. Get ready to dive into the heart of data preprocessing and regression modeling!\n\n## Data Transformations \n\nData transformations are a ubiquitous method in statistical analysis including air quality data. They help to stabilize variance, make the data more closely align with the assumptions of the inferential model, and improve interpretability. \n\n### Log, Square root & Box-Cox\n\nFor measurements that are skewed, we may apply transformations to reexpress our data for improved analysis. For instance, air pollutant data is often skewed right because it cannot go below zero, but there can be some very high values during pollution events.\n\nLet's import our air quality data and try out some transformations.\n  \n```R\n# Import the data\ndata <- read.csv(\"./data/chicago_air.csv\")\n\n# Apply a square root transformation\ndata$sqrt_ozone <- sqrt(data$ozone)\n\n# Apply a log transformation\ndata$log_ozone <- log(data$ozone)\n\n# Use the boxcox() function to do a Box-Cox transformation\nlibrary(MASS)  # boxcox() is in MASS package\ndata$bc_ozone <- boxcox(data$ozone ~ 1, lambda = seq(-0.5, 0.5, by=0.1))\n``` \n\nThe log, square root and Box-Cox are common transformations when dealing with skewed data. Note that Box-Cox is a family of transformations and requires us to choose a 'lambda' parameter that determines the specific transformation to apply.\n\n## Regression Analysis \n\nWe've previously built a simple linear model. It's now time to take it up a notch and bring our new skills together. \n\n### Simple Linear Regression Model \n\nJust to refresh, here's how you would build a simple linear model of the relationship of temperature with the ozone.\n\n```R\n# Fit the model\nmodel <- lm(ozone ~ temp, data = data)\n\n# Model summary\nsummary(model)\n```\n\nThis tells us if there's a statistically significant linear relationship between temperature and ground level ozone concentration. \n\n### Confidence Intervals \n\nWhile summarizing the model will give us coefficient estimates, we can also compute their confidence intervals using the `confint()` function.\n\n```R\n# Confidence intervals for model coefficients\nconfint(model)\n```\n\n## Missing Data \n\nReal-world air quality data often contains missing values, referred to as NAs in R. Before doing many operations in R, we usually need to handle these.\n\n### Handling Missing Values \n\n```R\n# Total number of NAs in dataset\nsum(is.na(data$ozone))\n\n# Remove rows with NA values\ndata <- na.omit(data)\n\n# Check if NAs are removed\nsum(is.na(data$ozone))\n```\n\n## Outliers \n\nFinally, let's discuss outliers in our data. Outliers can greatly affect our analysis, especially models because they can lead to erroneous conclusions. \n\n### Identifying and Handling Outliers\n\nLet's use boxplots to identify potential outliers in our dataset. Boxplots represent the median (middle line), first and third quartiles (box), and the range (whiskers). Outliers are shown as individual points outside the whiskers.\n\n```R\n# Create a boxplot\nboxplot(data$ozone, main = \"Boxplot of Ozone levels\", ylab = \"Ozone (ppm)\", col = \"blue\")\n```\nIf outliers are found, you could consider removing them, winsorizing the data (replacing outliers with less extreme values), or use robust statistical methods designed to be not too badly affected by outliers.\n\n## Wrapping up\n\nIn this lesson, we dove deep into the world of data pre-processing before regression analysis, including important topics like data transformations, regression modeling, handling missing data and outliers. All of these make up key steps for accurately interpreting real-world air quality data. \n\n**[Up Next](../8-quality-assurance/readme.tmd)**: As we near the end of this introductory R course, we will look at ensuring the quality of our data and output. Remember, there will always be garbage-in, garbage-out phenomenon in data science, to get quality output, you need to ensure the quality of the input. Head on over to the next lesson where we will learn techniques to assess and improve data quality!"
