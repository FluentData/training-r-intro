The lesson titled "Plotting with ggplot2" for the R programming course can be improved with the following changes:


* In the intro, explain that you will cover the built-in R functions plot(), hist(), and boxplot(). Then you will cover how to make those same plots with ggplot2. Do not make bar plots. Replace those plots with box plots.
* Use the same data for the built in functions and the ggplot2 functions.
* Move the explanation of how ggplot2 functions work to it's own section after covering built-in functions.
* As you add new customization functions to ggplot2 plots, explain what each function is before the example.
* Use color names. Do not use hex color codes.

1. **Goal/Objectives clarity**: At the beginning of a lesson, it is necessary to outline the goals, purpose, and what the students will achieve by the end of the lesson. Right now, the lesson dives directly into the contents. A paragraph just after the chapter title can be added to give a brief about what the chapter is about and what objectives the chapter fulfills.

2. **Learning Outcomes**: Each section should have intended learning outcomes for what the students should know or be able to do by the end of the section. These should be clearly marked and communicated to the students.

3. **Interactive Learning**: The lesson can be made more engaging by including in-line questions or interactive snippets that engage with or check onto the learners and their knowledge gained throughout the different sections of the lesson.

4. **Practical Examples**: Theoretical portions can be associated with more practical examples, analogies, or use-cases to make the learning more interesting, relatable, and real-world practical.

5. **Glossary of Terms**: At times, the lesson uses some technical terms that may not be known to beginners (even though the audience is assumed to have some basic understanding). Including a glossary of terms can be very helpful.

6. **Visual Aids**: Where necessary, include diagrams, flow charts, or pictures to illustrate the points to improve understanding. Screenshots of correct output—especially for plots—would also be useful.

7. **Troubleshooting Guide**: Provide some common errors and their solutions that students may encounter when trying to plot with ggplot2. This can be added at the end of each practice exercise.

8. **Additional Resources**: At the end of the lesson, provide links to further reading and advanced resources for those who are interested in going more in-depth with ggplot2.

9. **Layout and Structure**: Ensure that the formatting is consistent and clear throughout the lesson: this includes text formatting, code formatting, and the general layout of the lessons.

10. **Recap/Review**: At the end of the lesson, provide a summary of key points or a brief recap of what was covered in the lesson.
   
11. **Links Correction**: Check again the provided internal and external links in the lesson that they are correct and working fine. 

In summary, while the lesson contains solid educational material, these suggestions can enhance clarity, learner engagement, and the overall learning experience.
