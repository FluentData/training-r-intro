- Change the title to "Plotting". 
- In the intro, explain that you will cover the built-in R functions plot(),
hist(), and boxplot(). Then you will cover how to make those same plots
with ggplot2. Do not make bar plots. Replace those plots with box plots.
- Use the same data from the region5air package for the built in functions and
the ggplot2 functions.
- Move the explanation of how ggplot2 functions work to it's own section after
covering built-in functions.
- As you add new customization functions to ggplot2 plots, explain what each 
function is before the example.
- Use color names. Do not use hex color codes.
- In the exercises, use data from the region5air package.
