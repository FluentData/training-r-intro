    "content": "Rmarkdown is a superset of markdown. It allows you to embed R code in your markdown document. \nWhen you render the document, the R code is executed and the results are inserted into the final document. Below\nare some of the most common features of Rmarkdown that make it different from markdown.\n\n## Front Matter (YAML Header)\n\nUnlike .md files, .Rmd files require a YAML header at the top of the document. The header is enclosed by two lines with ---. \nIt can contain metadata such as title, author, date, and output format. An example YAML header might be:\n\n---\ntitle: \"My Analysis\"\nauthor: \"John Doe\"\ndate: \"2023-07-08\"\noutput:\n  html_document:\n    toc: true\n    theme: united\nparams:\n  sample_size: 100\n---\n\nCommon valid arguments that can appear in the YAML header include:\n\n  * **title**: The title of the document.\n  * **author**: The author(s) of the document. This can be a single author or a list.\n  * **date**: The date of the document.\n  * **output**: Specifies the output format of the document. This could be html_document, pdf_document, word_document, among others. \n  * **params**: You can use this field to parameterize your report. You can define parameters here and then refer to them in your document using params$param_name.\n  * **knit**: This is used to specify a custom rendering function. Normally, this isn't needed unless you're doing something complex or non-standard.\n  * **runtime**: This is used for \"notebook\" style .Rmd documents and can be set to shiny to make the document interactive or runtime: shiny_prerendered for an optimized version of Shiny.\n\n## R Code Chunks \n\nIn .Rmd files, you insert R code using chunks. A chunk starts and ends with three backticks, with {r} immediately following \nthe opening backticks to signify it's an R code chunk. For example, to create a histogram with the ggplot2 package, you would \ninclude a chunk like the following:\n\n```{r}\n    library(ggplot2)\n    ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ)) + \n      geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.5)\n```\n\n### R Code Chunk Options\n\nR code chunks can have options that control their behavior during knitting. Options are included in the chunk header right \nafter the `r`, like `{r option1 = value1, option2 = value2}`. Here are some of the most common options:\n\n  * eval: (TRUE/FALSE) If FALSE, the code chunk will not be evaluated, meaning the code won't be run.\n  * echo: (TRUE/FALSE) If FALSE, the code of the chunk will not be shown in the output document.\n  * include: (TRUE/FALSE) If FALSE, both the code and its results will be excluded from the output document.\n  * collapse: (TRUE/FALSE) If TRUE, the code and its output will be merged into a single block in the output.\n  * message: (TRUE/FALSE) If FALSE, messages generated by the code will not be included in the output.\n  * warning: (TRUE/FALSE) If FALSE, warnings generated by the code will not be included in the output.\n  * fig.cap: (\"text\") Provides a caption for figures generated by the code chunk.\n  * fig.height and fig.width: (numeric) Specify the height and width of the plot in inches.\n  * fig.align: (\"left\", \"center\", \"right\") Controls the alignment of the plot on the page.\n  * results: (\"markup\", \"hide\", \"asis\", \"hold\") Controls how the results are included in the output. \"markup\" \n             formats the results according to the output document type, \"hide\" hides the results, \"asis\" includes \n             the results as they are, and \"hold\" delays outputting the results until all code in the chunk has been evaluated.\n  * cache: (TRUE/FALSE) If TRUE, the results of the code chunk will be cached so they don't need to be recomputed each \n           time the document is compiled.\n  * dependson: (character vector) Specifies chunks that this chunk depends on. If any of those chunks change, this chunk \n               will be reevaluated even if caching is turned on.\n\n## Inline R Code\n\n  You can use R code inline with the rest of your text in .Rmd files. Enclose the R code with backticks and precede it with `r` \n  like so: `` `r 2 + 2` ``. This will be replaced by the result of the calculation when knit.\n\n## Rendering the Document\n\n  .Rmd documents are compiled using the `knitr` package to run the R code and the `rmarkdown` package to convert the .Rmd file \n  to its final output format. In RStudio, you can simply press the \"Knit\" button.\n\nYou're job is to convert lessons written in github-flavored markdown into Rmarkdown-based learnr tutorials. The user will present you\nwith a github-flavored markdown file and you will convert it to Rmarkdown that is suitable for use with the learnr package. This conversion\nincludes updating code chunks to use the learnr syntax, and adding a learnr tutorial header. It is important that you don't make significant\nto the content of the lesson, but rather focus on the conversion process and adding appropriate learnr exercises to the lesson.\n"

Thanks!\n\n# Plotting with ggplot2\n\nIn our [last lesson](../4-Writing-Functions-Conditionals-and-Loops), we finished automating our data processing tasks using functions, conditionals, and loops. Now we are ready to explore and understand our data better with visualizations. \n\n## Introduction to ggplot()\n\n`ggplot2` is a powerful and flexible data visualization package in R. It uses a layered approach to plot building, which allows you to add, remove or change components in a straightforward, transparent manner. \n\nTo use `ggplot2`, we typically follow a sequence of steps:\n\n1. Start with the `ggplot()` function where we specify the dataset and map variables to aesthetics (visual properties of objects in the plot like shapes or colors).\n2. Add `geoms` – geometric objects like points (`geom_point` for scatter plots), bars (`geom_bar` for bar plots), or lines (`geom_line` for line plots) that determine the type of the plot.\n3. Finally, customize and refine the plot with additional layers like labels, themes, facets etc.\n\nLet's begin by installing and loading the `ggplot2` package. If you haven't installed it before, uncomment and run the first line.\n\n```r\n# install.packages('ggplot2')\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n```\n\nNow we are ready to use `ggplot2` to make some plots!\n\n## Scatter Plot\n\nFor our first plot, let's create a scatter plot of ozone concentration (`ozone`) against temperature (`temp`) using the `chicago_air.csv` dataset. \n\n```r\n# Load the dataset\nair_quality <- read.csv('../data/chicago_air.csv')\n\n# Create a scatter plot\nggplot(air_quality, aes(x=temp, y=ozone)) +\n  geom_point()\n```\n\nIn this example, we have used `geom_point()` to create a scatter plot. The first argument to `ggplot()` function is the dataset `air_quality`. The `aes()` function is used to map the `temp` to x-axis and `ozone` to y-axis.\n\n## Customizing the Scatter Plot\n\nThe plot above is pretty basic. Let's customize it by adding color, title and labels.\n\n```r\n# Customized scatter plot\nggplot(air_quality, aes(x=temp, y=ozone)) +\n  geom_point(colour='#3366FF') +\n  ggtitle('Relationship between Ozone and Temperature') +\n  xlab('Temperature (°F)') +\n  ylab('Ozone (ppm)')\n```\n\nHere we used `geom_point(colour='#3366FF')` to change the point color, `ggtitle()` to add a title to the plot and `xlab()` & `ylab()` to label the x and y axes respectively.\n\n## Histogram\n\nNext, let's create a histogram of `ozone` concentrations.\n\n```r\n# Histogram\nggplot(air_quality, aes(x=ozone)) +\n  geom_histogram(binwidth=0.005, fill='#FF6633', color='black')\n```\n\nHistogram divides the continuous variable into bins (intervals) and count the number of observations in each bin. So unlike scatter plot, histogram only needs one variable (`ozone` in this case) which is passed to x. The `binwidth` argument controls the width of the bins and `fill` changes the color of the bars.\n\n## Faceted Bar Plot\n\nLastly, let's create a bar plot showing the average `ozone` concentration for each `month`, and facet it by `weekday`.\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the average `ozone` concentration per `month` and `weekday`. We will use `aggregate()` function from base R for this purpose.\n\n```r\n# Calculate mean ozone concentration per month and weekday\navg_ozone <- aggregate(ozone ~ month + weekday, data = air_quality, FUN = mean, na.rm = TRUE)\n\n# Create faceted bar plot\nggplot(avg_ozone, aes(x=month, y=ozone, fill=weekday)) +\n  geom_bar(stat='identity') +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  facet_wrap(~weekday) +\n  labs(title='Average Ozone Concentration per Month, Faceted by Weekday',\n       x='Month',\n       y='Average Ozone Concentration (ppm)')\n```\n\nHere we are using `geom_bar(stat='identity')` to create a bar plot. The `facet_wrap()` function creates a series of plots for each level of `weekday` factor. The `theme_minimal()` gives a clean white background.\n\n## Up Next\n\nIn this lesson, we used `ggplot2` to create and customize a variety of graphics. We covered the basics of the `ggplot()` function structure, and we practiced creating scatter plots, histograms, and bar plots, and learned how to facet our plots.\n\nIn our [next lesson](../6-Basic-Statistics-in-R), we will move into calculating common descriptive and inferential statistics such as mean, median, correlation, confidence intervals, t-tests, ANOVA, and linear models. We will use these statistical tools to continue exploring and gaining insights from our air quality datasets!"
