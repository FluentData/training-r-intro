## Lesson Structure

* The lesson did an excellent job of transitioning from the previous lesson
* The lesson followed the proposed template quite well. 
* Yet, there seems to be a discrepancy in the lesson title. Corresponding to the course outline provided, it should have started with a general overview of ‘Plotting with R’ and `ggplot2` should have come under its subheading.

General Feedback
* Use color names. Do not use hex color codes when defining plot colors.

## Lesson Sections

* Introduction
  * The introduction is quite well articulated conveying clearly what to expect in this lesson.
  * explain that you will cover the built-in R functions plot(), hist(), and boxplot(). Then you will cover how to make those same plots with ggplot2
* Introduction to ggplot()
  * Include an explanation of what a ggplot is before diving into how it is used
* Scatter Plot
  * The explanation is sufficient. However, it would be beneficial to include a note about what parameters `geom_point()` can accept
* Customizing the Scatter Plot
  * The section was well detailed but it should also use a callout box to highlight key customization features that make plots more informative and visually pleasing
* Histogram
  * The explanation of a histogram should not assume the reader knows its purpose. Briefly explain what histograms are generally used for in data analysis.
* Faceted Bar Plot
  * This section was detailed however it would have been beneficial to talk about when to use a faceted bar plot and its advantages.
  * The line `geom_bar(stat='identity')` could use a bit more explanation about what the `stat` parameter is doing.
  * This section could also greatly benefit from including a note or warning callout box about things to watch out for when creating faceted plots.
* Up next
  * The lesson finished well by summarizing the lesson and transitioning to the next lesson well.
