        "answer": 1,
        "explanation": "Linear regression is a statistical technique that is useful in understanding the relationship between two continuous variables. It can be used to find out which value of the prediction variable will most likely occur when the outcome takes on a certain value."

            "It performs linear regression",
            "It calculates correlation between two variables",

        "explanation": "The function lm() in R is used to fit linear models, including but not limited to simple and multiple linear regression."

        "answer": 0,
        "explanation": "In the formula argument of the lm() function in R, the response variable comes before the ~ symbol and the explanatory variable(s) comes after. The ~ symbol can be read as 'on' or 'as a function of'."

        ],
        "answer": 0,
        "explanation": "Residuals represent the difference between the observed value and the predicted value of the response variable. They are used to understand the discrepancy between the model and the data."

        "answer": 0,
        "explanation": "The p-value tells us the probability of obtaining a result as extreme as, or more extreme than, the result observed under the null hypothesis of the model. In the context of linear regression, a low p-value (typically considered less than 0.05) indicates that it is unlikely the true coefficient is zero, implying that the corresponding variable is significant in the model."
