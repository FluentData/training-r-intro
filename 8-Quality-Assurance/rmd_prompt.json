    "content": "Rmarkdown is a superset of markdown. It allows you to embed R code in your markdown document. \nWhen you render the document, the R code is executed and the results are inserted into the final document. Below\nare some of the most common features of Rmarkdown that make it different from markdown.\n\n## Front Matter (YAML Header)\n\nUnlike .md files, .Rmd files require a YAML header at the top of the document. The header is enclosed by two lines with ---. \nIt can contain metadata such as title, author, date, and output format. An example YAML header might be:\n\n---\ntitle: \"My Analysis\"\nauthor: \"John Doe\"\ndate: \"2023-07-08\"\noutput:\n  html_document:\n    toc: true\n    theme: united\nparams:\n  sample_size: 100\n---\n\nCommon valid arguments that can appear in the YAML header include:\n\n  * **title**: The title of the document.\n  * **author**: The author(s) of the document. This can be a single author or a list.\n  * **date**: The date of the document.\n  * **output**: Specifies the output format of the document. This could be html_document, pdf_document, word_document, among others. \n  * **params**: You can use this field to parameterize your report. You can define parameters here and then refer to them in your document using params$param_name.\n  * **knit**: This is used to specify a custom rendering function. Normally, this isn't needed unless you're doing something complex or non-standard.\n  * **runtime**: This is used for \"notebook\" style .Rmd documents and can be set to shiny to make the document interactive or runtime: shiny_prerendered for an optimized version of Shiny.\n\n## R Code Chunks \n\nIn .Rmd files, you insert R code using chunks. A chunk starts and ends with three backticks, with {r} immediately following \nthe opening backticks to signify it's an R code chunk. For example, to create a histogram with the ggplot2 package, you would \ninclude a chunk like the following:\n\n```{r}\n    library(ggplot2)\n    ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ)) + \n      geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.5)\n```\n\n### R Code Chunk Options\n\nR code chunks can have options that control their behavior during knitting. Options are included in the chunk header right \nafter the `r`, like `{r option1 = value1, option2 = value2}`. Here are some of the most common options:\n\n  * eval: (TRUE/FALSE) If FALSE, the code chunk will not be evaluated, meaning the code won't be run.\n  * echo: (TRUE/FALSE) If FALSE, the code of the chunk will not be shown in the output document.\n  * include: (TRUE/FALSE) If FALSE, both the code and its results will be excluded from the output document.\n  * collapse: (TRUE/FALSE) If TRUE, the code and its output will be merged into a single block in the output.\n  * message: (TRUE/FALSE) If FALSE, messages generated by the code will not be included in the output.\n  * warning: (TRUE/FALSE) If FALSE, warnings generated by the code will not be included in the output.\n  * fig.cap: (\"text\") Provides a caption for figures generated by the code chunk.\n  * fig.height and fig.width: (numeric) Specify the height and width of the plot in inches.\n  * fig.align: (\"left\", \"center\", \"right\") Controls the alignment of the plot on the page.\n  * results: (\"markup\", \"hide\", \"asis\", \"hold\") Controls how the results are included in the output. \"markup\" \n             formats the results according to the output document type, \"hide\" hides the results, \"asis\" includes \n             the results as they are, and \"hold\" delays outputting the results until all code in the chunk has been evaluated.\n  * cache: (TRUE/FALSE) If TRUE, the results of the code chunk will be cached so they don't need to be recomputed each \n           time the document is compiled.\n  * dependson: (character vector) Specifies chunks that this chunk depends on. If any of those chunks change, this chunk \n               will be reevaluated even if caching is turned on.\n\n## Inline R Code\n\n  You can use R code inline with the rest of your text in .Rmd files. Enclose the R code with backticks and precede it with `r` \n  like so: `` `r 2 + 2` ``. This will be replaced by the result of the calculation when knit.\n\n## Rendering the Document\n\n  .Rmd documents are compiled using the `knitr` package to run the R code and the `rmarkdown` package to convert the .Rmd file \n  to its final output format. In RStudio, you can simply press the \"Knit\" button.\n\nYou're job is to convert lessons written in github-flavored markdown into Rmarkdown-based learnr tutorials. The user will present you\nwith a github-flavored markdown file and you will convert it to Rmarkdown that is suitable for use with the learnr package. This conversion\nincludes updating code chunks to use the learnr syntax, and adding a learnr tutorial header. It is important that you don't make significant\nto the content of the lesson, but rather focus on the conversion process and adding appropriate learnr exercises to the lesson.\n"

Thanks!\n\n# Quality Assurance\n\nAs we have discussed before, the real-world data is often messy and requires a lot of cleaning. In this lesson, we will focus on some important aspects of quality assurance in data science like checking for outliers and uncommon values. We'll also learn how we can improve the quality of our data and automate these quality assurance tasks.\n\n_After completing this lesson, you will be able to:_\n\n- Check for outliers and common data issues\n- Use visual tools to perform quality assurance\n- Write functions to automate these QA checks\n\n## Checking Distributions\n\nBefore we perform any kind of analysis, it is important to understand the distributions of our data. **summary()** function is a quick way to get basic stats about your data like minimum, maximum, median, mean, 1st quartile and 3rd quartile.\n\n```r\nsummary(chicago_air$pollution)\n```\n\nWe can also visualize the distribution with histograms.\n\n```r\nhist(chicago_air$pollution)\n```\n\n> _**Info:** Histograms divide the data into bins and represent data distribution by plotting the frequency of the bins. They provide a visual representation of data distribution._\n\n## Visual Data Inspection\n\nScatter plots and density plots are other tools that can help us understand our data better.\n\nScatter plots can give us some intuition into the relationship between two variables.\n\n```r\nplot(chicago_air$pollution, chicago_air$temp)\n```\n\nThen we can use density plots to visualize the distribution of a single variable. The y-axis is the density which depends on the count and becomes a probability when integrated over the range of x values.\n\n```r\nplot(density(chicago_air$pollution))\n```\n\n## Checking Data Properties: Outliers and Ranges\n\nChecking if the values are within the expected range can help identify entry errors or other problems.\n\n```r\nany(chicago_air$pollution < 0)\n```\n\nIdentifying outliers with boxplots:\n\n```r\nboxplot(chicago_air$pollution, main = \"Boxplot of Air Pollution\", ylab=\"Pollution\")\n```\n\n> _**Info:** Boxplots provide a summary of the minimum, first quartile, median, third quartile, and maximum in a visual way. We can also identify outliers (if present) using whisker of the boxplot._\n\n## Automating Quality Assurance\n\nInstead of manually checking every dataset, we can write functions to automate this.\n\n```r\nqa_check <- function(df, var){\n  print(summary(df[,var]))\n  plot(density(df[,var]))\n  print(any(df[,var] < 0))\n  boxplot(df[,var])\n}\n\n# Call the function on pollution data\nqa_check(chicago_air, \"pollution\")\n```\n\nBy making a report that compiles all these checks for all variables, we can quickly identify any potential data issues.\n\n---\n\nCongratulations, you made it to the end of the Introduction to R for Air Quality Data Science course! In today's lesson, we've learned how to perform some basic quality assurance checks on our data to ensure that it's clean and ready to use. We've looked into histograms, density plots, scatter plots, and box plots. We also automated our QA tasks with functions. Your newfound knowledge on cleaning and preparing data will prove incredibly useful in your day-to-day data science tasks!\n\nHappy Coding!\n\n_Up next, check out more advanced topics in R and environmental science with **[R for Environmental Data Analysis](../r-for-environmental-data-analysis/readme.md)**._"
