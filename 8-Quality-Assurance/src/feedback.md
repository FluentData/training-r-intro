## Lesson Structure

* Introduction 
    * The introduction provides an overview of the content but does not appear to summarize the previous lesson as required. Include a summary of the preceding lesson. 
    * A recap of criteria for what might constitute poor data quality and why it's important might be beneficial here. 

## Lesson Sections

* Checking Distributions
    * More elaboration is needed on the significance of examining data distributions and what certain distributions might signify about the data quality.
    * The histogram's function should also give a brief note on what histograms reveal about the shape, center and spread of data.
* Visual Data Inspection
    * This section could benefit from a more detailed discussion of how scatter and density plots contribute to QA.
    * Scatter plots - Elaborate on what kind of relationships or patterns between the variables one might look for and why it would be useful.
    * Density Plots - Explain more about the shape, center, and spread of the data distribution as it relates to data integrity.
* Checking Data Properties: Outliers and Ranges
    * Elaborate how the range of values can indicate data quality issues or anomalies.
    * Explain how Boxplots are particularly useful in identifying outliers, adding context for beginners.
    * Provide a more in-depth explanation of how outliers can hamper analyses or skew outcome, particularly in statistical models.
* Automating Quality Assurance
    * The introduction of this section could discuss why automating QA tasks is beneficial, particularly in large datasets.
    * Include an example or note about how the function might need to be modified if there were issues with data other than numeric (e.g., categorical).

## Overall
* Include a 'summary' or 'key points' section at the end to recap the main learning points.
* The lesson is somewhat beginner-oriented, but some of the concepts could be complex without further elaboration or simplification.
* Consider including exercises for hands-on learning and reinforcement of concepts. 
* There are quite a few code examples, which are beneficial. However, some of them could use more detailed explanation. For instance, why are we checking if pollution values are less than 0 in the 'Checking Data Properties' section? 
* Be aware that this lesson relies heavily on the `chicago_air` dataset, and much of the context is lost from the excerpts. Adding more context about the dataset or the specific variables being used (like pollution) could be helpful. 
* Adding something about QA for different types of variables (e.g., continuous, categorical) might be useful. Different types of variables might have different types of QA checks. For instance, categorical variables might need to check for consistency in category naming, etc. 
* Make it clear what type of variables the introduced QA techniques apply to best. 
* In the sample QA function, there's a lot of output generated. New coders might find this overwhelming. Perhaps, summarizing or reducing output could be addressed in comments. 
* You briefly mention generating a report to compile QA checks but don't provide an example. Including a simple example would be beneficial.
