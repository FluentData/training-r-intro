    "content": "Rmarkdown is a superset of markdown. It allows you to embed R code in your markdown document. \nWhen you render the document, the R code is executed and the results are inserted into the final document. Below\nare some of the most common features of Rmarkdown that make it different from markdown.\n\n## Front Matter (YAML Header)\n\nUnlike .md files, .Rmd files require a YAML header at the top of the document. The header is enclosed by two lines with ---. \nIt can contain metadata such as title, author, date, and output format. An example YAML header might be:\n\n---\ntitle: \"My Analysis\"\nauthor: \"John Doe\"\ndate: \"2023-07-08\"\noutput:\n  html_document:\n    toc: true\n    theme: united\nparams:\n  sample_size: 100\n---\n\nCommon valid arguments that can appear in the YAML header include:\n\n  * **title**: The title of the document.\n  * **author**: The author(s) of the document. This can be a single author or a list.\n  * **date**: The date of the document.\n  * **output**: Specifies the output format of the document. This could be html_document, pdf_document, word_document, among others. \n  * **params**: You can use this field to parameterize your report. You can define parameters here and then refer to them in your document using params$param_name.\n  * **knit**: This is used to specify a custom rendering function. Normally, this isn't needed unless you're doing something complex or non-standard.\n  * **runtime**: This is used for \"notebook\" style .Rmd documents and can be set to shiny to make the document interactive or runtime: shiny_prerendered for an optimized version of Shiny.\n\n## R Code Chunks \n\nIn .Rmd files, you insert R code using chunks. A chunk starts and ends with three backticks, with {r} immediately following \nthe opening backticks to signify it's an R code chunk. For example, to create a histogram with the ggplot2 package, you would \ninclude a chunk like the following:\n\n```{r}\n    library(ggplot2)\n    ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ)) + \n      geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.5)\n```\n\n### R Code Chunk Options\n\nR code chunks can have options that control their behavior during knitting. Options are included in the chunk header right \nafter the `r`, like `{r option1 = value1, option2 = value2}`. Here are some of the most common options:\n\n  * eval: (TRUE/FALSE) If FALSE, the code chunk will not be evaluated, meaning the code won't be run.\n  * echo: (TRUE/FALSE) If FALSE, the code of the chunk will not be shown in the output document.\n  * include: (TRUE/FALSE) If FALSE, both the code and its results will be excluded from the output document.\n  * collapse: (TRUE/FALSE) If TRUE, the code and its output will be merged into a single block in the output.\n  * message: (TRUE/FALSE) If FALSE, messages generated by the code will not be included in the output.\n  * warning: (TRUE/FALSE) If FALSE, warnings generated by the code will not be included in the output.\n  * fig.cap: (\"text\") Provides a caption for figures generated by the code chunk.\n  * fig.height and fig.width: (numeric) Specify the height and width of the plot in inches.\n  * fig.align: (\"left\", \"center\", \"right\") Controls the alignment of the plot on the page.\n  * results: (\"markup\", \"hide\", \"asis\", \"hold\") Controls how the results are included in the output. \"markup\" \n             formats the results according to the output document type, \"hide\" hides the results, \"asis\" includes \n             the results as they are, and \"hold\" delays outputting the results until all code in the chunk has been evaluated.\n  * cache: (TRUE/FALSE) If TRUE, the results of the code chunk will be cached so they don't need to be recomputed each \n           time the document is compiled.\n  * dependson: (character vector) Specifies chunks that this chunk depends on. If any of those chunks change, this chunk \n               will be reevaluated even if caching is turned on.\n\n## Inline R Code\n\n  You can use R code inline with the rest of your text in .Rmd files. Enclose the R code with backticks and precede it with `r` \n  like so: `` `r 2 + 2` ``. This will be replaced by the result of the calculation when knit.\n\n## Rendering the Document\n\n  .Rmd documents are compiled using the `knitr` package to run the R code and the `rmarkdown` package to convert the .Rmd file \n  to its final output format. In RStudio, you can simply press the \"Knit\" button.\n\nYou're job is to convert lessons written in github-flavored markdown into Rmarkdown-based learnr tutorials. The user will present you\nwith a github-flavored markdown file and you will convert it to Rmarkdown that is suitable for use with the learnr package. This conversion\nincludes updating code chunks to use the learnr syntax, and adding a learnr tutorial header. It is important that you don't make significant\nto the content of the lesson, but rather focus on the conversion process and adding appropriate learnr exercises to the lesson.\n"

Thanks!\n\n# Subsetting, Sorting, and Combining Data\n\nAs we venture deeper into R, it becomes essential to know how to examine, slice and dice the data to satisfy our analytical needs. In the [previous lesson](../2-Functions-and-Data-Import/readme.tmd), we learned how to import data and use functions. Now, we will delve into how to subset data frames, arrange the data in a particular source and combine multiple data frames.\n\n## Viewing Your Data Frame\n\nTo have a sneak-peek into your data, you can harness the power of functions like `head()`, `tail()`, and `View()`.\n\n### head()\n\nThe `head()` function shows us the first six rows of the data frame. Use this to get an initial glimpse into the dataset.\n\n```R\n# Show first 6 rows of the dataset\nhead(dataset)\n```\n\n### tail()\n\nSimilarly, `tail()` gives us the last six rows. This allows you to see the more recent data if your data frame is ordered by time.\n\n```R\n# Show last 6 rows of the dataset\ntail(dataset)\n```\n\n### View()\n\nLastly, `View()` opens a more user-friendly Data Viewer. This way you can manually scroll through the entire dataset.\n\n```R\n# Visualize the dataset\nView(dataset)\n```\n\n## Subsetting Your Data\n\nOnce you have a handle on what the data looks like, the next course of action is often to select a subset of the data for analysis. We typically do it using `[]`, `$`, and `filter()`.\n\n### Indexing with []\n\n`[]` brackets are a universal way to subset an element from a data structure. To select a particular subset in a data frame, use `[row, column]`.\n\n```R\n# Get the ozone value from the 3rd row\ndataset[3, \"ozone\"]\n```\n### Using $\n\nA handy trick, when you are subsetting a single column, is to use `$`. It is typically used to extract named columns.\n\n```R\n# Get all ozone values\ndataset$ozone\n```\n\n### filter()\n\nThe `filter()` function is used to subset rows based on their values. This function is part of the `dplyr` library, which we'll learn more about in upcoming lessons.\n\n```R\n# Get rows where ozone is greater than 0.04\nfilter(dataset, ozone > 0.04)\n```\n\n## Sorting Data Frames\n\nOnce you have selected your subset, you might want to order it in a particular sequence. The `arrange()` function helps to do so.\n\n```R\n# Sort the dataset by pressure in ascending order\narrange(dataset, pressure)\n```\n\nFor descending order, use `desc()` function.\n\n```R\n# Sort the dataset by temperature in descending order\narrange(dataset, desc(temp))\n```\n\n## Combining Data Frames\n\nFinally, you might have similar data frames that you want to combine for an overall analysis. `bind_rows()` function lets you do just that.\n\n```R\n# Combine two similar datasets\nbind_rows(dataset1, dataset2)\n```\nIn this session, we learned to index, subset, sort and combine data frames. These techniques can help you immensely in extracting information needed to carry out your analysis in R. Be sure to practice selecting, ordering, and joining datasets to get a good grip on these concepts.\n\n**Up Next:** Our next session, [Writing Functions, Conditionals, and Loops](../4-Writing-Functions-Conditionals-and-Loops/readme.tmd), becomes more exciting as we will learn how to automate data tasks by writing reusable functions, conditional logic and loops."
