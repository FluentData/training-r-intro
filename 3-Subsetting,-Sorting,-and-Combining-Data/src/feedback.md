## Lesson Structure

* The lesson introduction and conclusion are well-structured but lack some information about how the topic is relevant or helpful for the target audience. Consider adding some example use-cases or testimonials about why and how subsetting, sorting, and combining data is critical in data analysis.
 
## Lesson Sections

* **Viewing Your Data Frame**: Good introduction, but a summary/definition of what a data frame is could be useful for learners who might've forgotten.
* **head()**, **tail()**, and **View()**: Good, clear explanations of these functions. However, the 'view()' function's explanation was incomplete about how it can be used interactively.
* **Subsetting Your Data**: The introduction to this section was adequately explained, but the practical applications and examples of how this might be used in a real-world scenario were lacking.
* **Indexing with [], Using $, and filter()**: These subsections were well-explained technically; however, they lacked continuity and cohesion with each other. Consider providing a brief introduction to their connection and differences before diving into each one individually.
* **Sorting Data Frames**: Good introduction, but the implementation of the 'desc()' function needs to be clarified. The description denotes that it's a standalone function when it's a parameter within the 'arrange()' function.
* **Combining Data Frame**: Good explanation, but Implementing 'bind_rows()' in different scenarios and a potential warning when trying to combine data frames with different structures or column names can potentially improve this section.
 
## Tone and Voice

* The tone and voice is generally fine. Still, it sometimes slips into more passive structures - for example, "Once you have selected your subset, you might want to order it in a particular sequence. " would be more engaging and active as "When you select a subset, order it using the `arrange()` function to aid your analysis."
 
## Style Guide

* The lesson generally follows the style guide. However, please add more formatting tools such as list, code blocks, and headers to enhance readability. Also, consider adding tables or images to illustrate the data frame and its operations visually.
* There were a few cases of passive voice, as pointed out earlier. Encouraging more learner participation can significantly enhance the engagement level of the lesson.
 
## Length and Scope

* The length and scope of the lesson are appropriate for the topics covered, and the lesson offers a good balance of information and coding exercise. The content fits the 'beginner' level. However, to encourage more practice, the lesson could greatly benefit from adding more coding exercises, especially at the end. 

## Audience and Relevance

* Target audiences of this lesson are described as "Air Quality Data Analysts and Regulators with a strong background in using Excel for data analysis." Although this lesson provides the fundamental R programming operations useful to the audience, it does not include any context or examples specific to air quality analysis. It would benefit from incorporating data and scenarios related to air quality to make it more relevant and engaging for the intended audience.

## Additional Comments

* Formatting of code blocks is nice and easy to read.
* Depth of concepts is good, however, more real-world examples to explain concepts would be helpful.

## Recommended Changes:

* Introduction
    - Add a summary of how Checking, Subsetting, Sorting and Combining of Data is used in the practice of data analysis
* head(), tail()
    - Include an example of each function
* view()
    - An extra example of how to navigate the data viewer would be helpful
* Subsetting Your Data
    - Give examples of practical application of this concept
* Indexing with [], Using $, and filter()
    - Add an introduction to tie these concepts together before the explanation of each
* Sorting data frame
    - Provide more information on the use of 'desc' within the 'arrange' function and why we might want to use it
* Combining data frames
    - Suggest different scenarios where using bind_rows could be useful
    - And warning about trying o combine data frames with different structures
* Tone and Voice
    - Encourage use of more active voice and sentences to engage readers
* Style Guide
    - Use more formatting resources such as the list, code blocks, headers etc to enhance readability
    - Incorporate tables or images to illustrate data frames and its operations
* Length and Scope
    - The scope is fine but can benefit with more practical examples for beginners to practice
* Audience and relevance
    - Incorporate data and scenarios related to air quality to make it more relevant to the audience
