I am planning a revision to a course titled "Introduction to R for Air Quality Data Science." I am providing you with some 
information about the course and I want your help further planning things out.  Here is some background info:
 
- **Course Goals and Objectives**
    
    - What are the primary goals of the course?
	    - To give students a basic understanding of how to use R. The goal is to help students learn how to leverage R in
        conjunction with their own specialized knowledge to make their jobs easier, and their work more reproducible
    - What skills or knowledge should students have upon completing the course?
	    - The basic understanding install and use R and RStudio.
	    - How to import and manipulate data in R
	    - How to write functions
	    - How to process multiple dataset by using Conditionals and Loops
	    - The basics of producing plots with R, primarily using ggplot2.
	    - How to do basic statistics in R
	    - Basic Regression and data transformation in R
	    - How to perform basic data quality assurance in R  

- **Target Audience**
    
    - Who is the intended audience for this course?
	    - Air Quality Data Analysts and Regulators that work for state-level environmental agencies in the United States Midwest 
    - What is their expected educational background?
	    - A strong understanding of state and federal air regulations
	    - A background of using Excel for data analysis in the past.
	    - No or little experience with R.
    - What pre-requisites, if any, are necessary for this course?
	    - There are no prerequisites for this course
    - What are their likely motivations or goals in taking this course?
	    - The students in this course are looking for ways to improve their productivity in their jobs by leveraging R to produce
        higher-quality, more reproducible data products.

- **Content Development**
    
    - What types of content will be used for this course? 
	- This course will be available in a number of formats:
		- Github-flavored markdown documents hosted in a repo on GitHub
		- learnr tutorials available through a custom R package
		- A website hosted on github pages.
	- This course is meant to teach the basics of using R. It is geared towards Air Quality Data Analysts and Regulators and should
    use examples relevent to them whenever possible but isn't meant to teach Air Data Analysis or Regulation, just the basics of R
   within the context of Air Quality Data Analysis and Regulation.

The original course had the following lessons:

- Introduction to R
- Functions and Importing Data
- Sub-setting, Sorting, and Combining Data 
- Writing Functions, Conditionals, and Loops
- Plotting
- Basic Statistics
- Regression and Data Transformation
- Quality Assurance


The first three lessons have already been revised. Here is an brief outline of those lessons:

## Lesson 1: Introduction to R and RStudio

#### Learning Objectives

- Install and setup R and RStudio
- Understand core R concepts like variables, data types, vectors, lists, matrices, data frames
- Perform basic math and assign variables
- Write comments and format code

#### Topics

- What is R?
    - Overview of R as a programming language for data analysis. Brief history.
- Why use R?
   - Advantages over spreadsheets and BI tools for custom analysis and modeling.
- Installing R and RStudio
   - Downloading and installing R and RStudio IDE.
- RStudio IDE overview
    - Tour of the RStudio interface and panes. Setting working directory.
- Basic Math
   - Arithmetic operators. Order of operations. 
- Variables
   - Assigning values to variables with <-. Variable naming rules.
- Data Types
   - Overview of R's basic data types - numeric, character, logical.
- Data Structures
   - Vectors, lists, matrices, data frames. Creating them in R.
- Code Comments
   - Commenting code with #. Code blocks for sharing code.

## Lesson 2: Functions and Data Import

#### Learning Objectives

- Understand what functions are and how to use them 
- Use built-in R functions like mean(), paste(), seq()
- Install and load R packages
- Import CSV and Excel data into R

#### Topics

- Functions in R
   - Definition of a function. Using functions with arguments.
- Built-in R functions
   - Examples of common functions like mean(), paste(), seq() 
- Nesting functions
   - Placing functions inside other functions.
- R packages
   - Installing packages from CRAN. Loading with library().
- Importing data
   - Reading CSVs with read.csv(). Reading Excel with readxl package.
   
The revised outline covers the key topics in the lesson markdown: 

- What functions are and how to call them
- Using common built-in functions 
- Nesting functions
- Finding and installing R packages
- Importing CSV and Excel datasets into R
## Lesson 3: Subsetting, Sorting, and Combining Data

#### Learning Objectives

- Subset data frames using indexing, logical operators, filter()
- Sort data frames with arrange()
- Combine data frames together with bind_rows() 

#### Topics  

- Viewing Data Frames
   - head(), tail(), View()
- Subsetting
   - [row,col], $column, filter() with logical operators  
- Sorting
   - arrange(), desc()
- Combining
   - bind_rows() to append data frames  

I need to outline the rest of the course in the same format as provided for the first 3 lessons. The rest of the 
course does not need to follow the original course exactly but should stick to introductory topics that fit 
within the course. Please outline the rest of the course for me.
