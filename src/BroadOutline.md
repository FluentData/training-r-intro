# Introduction to R for Air Quality Data Science

This introductory course provides environmental professionals with a practical foundation in using the R programming 
language for air quality data analysis. Through a series of hands-on lessons and coding exercises, learners will become 
proficient in R programming fundamentals like data import, transformation, visualization, and modeling. Core skills 
covered include data wrangling with dplyr, plotting with ggplot2, writing functions, iteration, and statistical analysis.
Examples and datasets are drawn from real-world air monitoring data to ensure direct relevance to those working in air 
quality and atmospheric science. Upon completing this course, students will have the ability to leverage R's powerful 
capabilities to conduct customized analysis, save time on routine tasks, and improve the quality and reproducibility of
their work.
