Each lesson has its own directory, within each lesson directory there is an images directory that can hold images for the lesson and a readme.tmd file that serves as the source document for the lesson. The lesson directories may have other files that are used to help render the trainings in their final formats. The example datasets for the lessons are available in the data/ folder along with a readme.md file that describes the datasets. The top level README.md file is the course overview, license.md is the license for the course, and change_log.md is a log of changes made to the course.
