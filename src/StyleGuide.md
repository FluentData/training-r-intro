# Lesson Style Guide

  Use short, simple sentences that are easy to understand and avoid complex grammatical structures. Maintain a conversational tone using contractions and everyday language while explaining technical terms when first introduced. Avoid unnecessary jargon and use plain language descriptions. Keep paragraphs focused on one main idea and break up long blocks of text. Use an active voice with "we" instead of passive voice and adopt a friendly, encouraging tone towards the reader. Follow a consistent structure in each lesson with learning objectives, overviews, examples, summaries and exercises. Leverage formatting tools like headers, lists, code blocks and links to enhance readability. Include images and tables to visually demonstrate concepts and break up lessons. Provide clear instructions when asking readers to complete coding exercises. Maintain a professional, educational tone even with a friendly style. Examples and exercises should be relevant to the target audience and use real-world data from the available datasets when possible.

## Structure
  - After the H1 title, have a short paragraph reviewing the previous lesson and introducing the lesson topics
  - Use an H2 header for each major topic
  - For longer topics, break into H3 subheaders
  - Highlight key takeaways with callout boxes that are block quotes with an indicator of the type of callout like info, tip, or warning
  - Finish with a "Up Next" section that briefly describes what was learned in this lesson and how it ties into the next lesson with a
    inline link forward to the next lesson

## Formatting
  - Use consistent Markdown formatting
      - H1 and H2 headers
      - Inline code with backticks
      - Code blocks with three backticks
      - Bold **text** and italics _text_ for emphasis
      - Numbered and bulleted lists for key points
  - Format images with a title above and center align
  - When adding an image, provide a description of what should be in the image as a comment
  - Format tables with header row and lines above and below
  - Use horizontal rules `---` to separate major sections
  - Use in-line code comments with `#` to explain code
  - Format tips/notes with blockquote formatting `>`

---

## Length and Scope
- Keep lessons to around 1,000 - 1,500 words each  
- Each lesson covers one self-contained topic. Don't try to cram multiple big ideas into one lesson or conversely drag out one concept over multiple lessons.
- Include 2 - 5 hands-on coding exercises at the end of each lesson. Don't have just 1 or 10+ exercises per lesson.
- Lessons should take around 30-45 minutes to complete as a general guideline. Don't cover so little it takes just 10 mins or so much it takes over an hour.
- Use 5-10 example code blocks in each lesson. Don't have just 1-2 examples or so many it becomes hard to follow.
- Cover just enough material to achieve the core learning objectives stated at the beginning. Don't go on tangents or down rabbit holes.
- Stick to base R functions unless there is a widely used dplyr/tidyverse function available.
- Re-use the same example dataset(s) when possible instead of introducing new data for every lesson.
